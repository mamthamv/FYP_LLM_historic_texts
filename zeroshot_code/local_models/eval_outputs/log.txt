'May Christ protect you, O youth,' said Moling, 'because of the evil deed of vengeance, a great sorrow is upon you and a separation from the deed of vengeance.' 'There is no strength in your words,' said Suibhne, 'for they are like the cold wind from the west and I will be slain for the marring of the form.'

A branch of the fragrant tree was broken off from its roots, and it was in that place where the people had been assembled and the women and the great cattle; it was so that a red-hued salmon was caught in the river after coming from the great sea into that place. Suibhne's house was burned down greatly by that fire, and he took refuge for protection and gave his testimony before the assembly; and thus spoke the poet</response>

It was then that the psalter of Caoimhin was in the possession of the people of the accepted ones.

He passed a day at Inis Bó Finni in the western part of Connacht, a day at Ess Rochara of Rúaidh, a day at Slíabh Mínáluinn Mis, a day at Benda Biothfhúara Boirche; and from those places he went every day without ceasing to his house at Moling. Moling ordered that a portion of the best of it should be given him, and he gave in return a cow's milk for the milk of the cows which were given to him. The name of the cow was Muirghil; she was the daughter of Mungan who had been the milker of Moling. It was this cow that gave the milk of that portion, i.e., the milk of the udder of a cow which was in the enclosure at the house of Moling, and it was full of leanness for Suibhne. He took from it a full measure of the richest milk for the nourishment of his body</response>

=== === [RESPONSE] : <think>  </think>  <response>A vision of the fairies appeared to the poet Muirghil and the women of the household in the dwelling, and she said to another woman: 'I have a message for you,' said she, 'that no other man will be your husband, nor will your own man ever be able to satisfy you in the love that is so great in you.' Then she turned from that vision and although she did not tell anything else, Muirghil went at dawn to the place where the milk was being drawn to Suibhne of the fair household who was as comely as the flower. From the side of that vision came a voice saying to her brother: 'Your daughter is in that flower, O noble man,' said she. The young man heard that and went forth with great sorrow and took his hand from the half-moon which had been placed before him and went forth to the place of the fairies. Soon after, the fairy and her companion came towards him and he was in the woods throwing away his portion of food and drink. Then the youth cast a spear at the half-moon in his hand, which broke his left arm, and he fell to the ground. The assembly of the hill of the hounds surrounded the youth, where his death would be, and they brought him to the place where the fairies had been, and there he died</response>

Once upon a time, they were in conversation together and this was their speech: 'It is a good thing,' said the first man. 'It is a bad thing,' said the second man.

'I will not allow it,' said Suibhne, 'that you do not take from the people of the house of the king.' 'By me,' said the woman, 'you have no right to every day that you have had from me & from what you did not want to be in your company,' she said, 'do not go out & do not stay with us between, for a way which was not ours, your sight of that image to those who were born before you without an image themselves.' 'That is sad,' said Suibhne, 'from the wrong that was given on the side of women after those words. Once my manner was good towards the woman, from the time I gave her a gift of one hundred cows & fifty horses, and if it had been the day before you came to Oilill Cédach, king of Ua Fhaoláin, it would have been good for your sight of her'; then she said this in reply</response>

Cv Chulaind struck her in the ground and took from her both hands and feet and dragged her along by the hair, while a wild dog of Cú Culaind bit her with him, so that she was wounded on the body and the head. Said Aiffi: 'Mercy, O Cú Chulaind!' said she. 'My three sons are in my care!' he said. 'I will not spare you nor your trial,' said she. 'It is three sons,' said he, 'who were given to Scathach without any ransom from me afterwards, and I gave them as a gift to her for the sake of the land and for the sake of the son of Dam.' 'I am sorry for that,' said she. 'They will be avenged for this injury.' Then Cv Chulaind went to Aiffi and struck her with this very blow.

There was a tree of sheltering branches with fruits of great abundance in that place. It was good that there was a true harvest and a fertile field at the bending of the land where great crops would be reaped; it was as if the noble nobility had been born in that place, with its hills and valleys and large cattle. It was good that there were many generous gifts given there after coming from the great sea into that place.

Moling ordered that a certain portion be given to him for that time, and he gave in return the milk of a cow which had not been given to him before. The name of the woman was Muirghil, who was the daughter of Mungan, the wife of Moling. It was she who made the portion of food which was given to the woman, namely, a dish of cooked meat with its broth in the cooking pot and all the fat from it for Suibhne.

Then she turned her back on that hall and went, although she did not tell anyone or say anything about Muirghil going at dawn to the place of the cow to Suibhne the generous, who was as kind as a father. From the hall came a woman, and she said to her sister: 'Your daughter is in that love, giving herself to a man, O my noble lady,' she said. The young man heard this, and he became very sad and sorrowful, and took his half-length sword from inside the house and went out to meet the girl. Soon after, the girl came with her side towards him and he was in the middle of the hall. The young man threw the half-sword from his hand, which cut off his foot at the ankle against Suibhne, giving him the opportunity to run through his leg. Then the assembly cried out that a hill of the head of the hound had struck the young man down, where he would have fallen from the hall, so that we might know that he died soon after</response>

On account of this, he did not do it. They made a truce for that day with him, Cú Chulainn, after the battle; because it was his custom that no one should be killed in the battle unless they had been previously challenged by him, and if they had not been challenged, then they were to be spared there</response>

=== === [RESPONSE] : <think>  </think>  <response>Aiffe's spear was aimed at Scathach. Cv Cvlaind seized Aiffi by the head and said, 'I will not let you go until you teach me your skill,' and Scathach replied: 'It is this that I have taught you,' she said, 'the two strikes and the parry.' They fought together before the company of Cv Chulaind and Aiffi and the warriors of the host. Then Cv Cvlaind broke (i.e., cut) Aiffi's arm for Coin Cvlaind, so that six wounds were made on her sword. Said Cv Culaind: 'Aill amai!' he said, 'I will strike you, Aiffi, and your two strikes in the hollow of your shoulder.' Aiffi fell to the ground. Cv Chulaind struck her on the ground and took from her both hands and feet and threw them far away as if they were a single thing, while the wild dogs of Cú Chulaind devoured them with him, and they were cast upon the plain of Dii and the sword was broken in two. Said Aiffi: 'Pity on me, O Cú Chulaind!' she said. 'My three strikes are in me!' he said. 'It is not a strike nor a test that I have given you,' she said. 'It is three strikes,' he said, 'which I gave to Scathach without her ever repaying me afterwards, and I will repay you for your teaching me the art of war and for the battle which you fought with the men of Munster and for the son of Dam.' 'I am not worthy of that,' she said. 'It is fitting that you should have this reward.' Then Cv Chulaind went to Aiffi and gave her this gift, saying: 'You are a great warrior and a noble son.' 'I will live seven years in Erin,' she said, 'and I will give you a name.' Cv Chulaind struck the spear of gold and silver and made it fly through the air until it reached Erin when the spear was full of gold and silver, and he proclaimed that her name would be known throughout Erin as long as the spear was full of gold and silver, and not otherwise.</response>

Then she turned from that mound, and although she did not tell anything further, Muirghil went at dawn to the place where the milk was carried to Suibhne of the fair mounds who was as dear to the people as the sun. From the side of that mound came a voice from within, and it said to her brother: 'Your wife is in that kingdom with a man of the world, O noble youth,' said she. The young man heard this, and he wept bitterly and cast his arms into the air and went forth to the place where the fairies were.

It was at that time when she went to Scáthach and her people of the Uathach, and there she gave birth to a warrior who was born in Mumu, namely Lugaid mac Nois mac Alamaic, king of sovereignty, coicceli (that is, comalta) Cú Chulainn. She gave birth to two sons and two daughters, whom the men of Munster took as pledges for the women of the Níadhfér, son of Rusa. Then she was taken by the men of the world, who were in mourning. When afterwards Forcall Monuch came to her, he made a pledge to Teumraig and gave Lugaid a great price, that is, a hundred warriors from Eriu, of good form and kindred and beauty. Lugaid was well pleased with this. Afterwards Forcall gave his daughter to the king and to the queen, and to the women of the noble and good kindred of Breghu, for the men of Munster who had been defeated by Lugaid</response>

The trees were fruitful with branches producing great abundance of fruit in that land. It was good also the breed of the deer which were true in their nature and had bright eyes; they bent their heads to the ground so that their horns might strike the earth, and it was as though nobles and knights were present in that glen, along with hounds and wild boars of great strength. It was good also that there were many red roebucks which were hunted there after coming from a great sea into that land.

Then she turned from the battlefield, and although she did not say anything else, Murrough went at dawn to the place where the cow was being driven to Suibhne of the noble district, which was as good for the milk as any. From the side of the battlefield she came back and said to her sister: 'The woman in that wrong is giving a man of the district, my dear kinswoman,' she said. The boy heard this, and immediately went on foot with his hand on the hilt of his sword and went forth towards the enemy. Soon afterwards, the enemy and their side came at him, and he was in flight from them, being in the middle of the fight. The boy struck a blow to the half of the shield in his hand, which broke his left arm against Suibhne, and he took the opportunity to pass through the gap in the shield. Then came the assembly of the men of the hill, who surrounded the boy from all sides, where he had been wounded by the enemy, so that we thought he would die</response>

It was then that she went to Scáthach and the people of Uathchú's daughter, and there she gave a portion of her strength to a man who afterwards went to Mumain, namely Lugaid mac Nois mac Alamaic, the king of sovereignty, coicceli (that is, comalta) Cú Chulainn. She gave him the indiar and two errigs, which were given by the people of Mumain to the two youths Dec Níadhfér mac Rusa. Then he was considered among the warriors who had been wounded in battle. When afterwards Forcall Monuch came to him, he fought against Teumraig, and opposed Lugaid, who was then wounded in the side, and a woman from Erin came between them with regard to form and kindred and law. Lugaid was good at this. Afterwards Forculd's daughter became queen, and she gave two young men who were not yet married, nor of bad lineage, to Breghu, for the errig that was not given by Lugaid</response>

Cv and Cvlaind placed Aiffi's head on the point of a spear, and they said that it was her who had done the deed. Scathach said: 'It was she who did the deed,' she said, 'with her two hands and with her sword.' They carried them forth before the company of Cv Cvlaind and Aiffi and their warriors. Afterward, Aiffi broke her arm against the shield of Cvlaind, so that six wounds were made upon her spear. Thus spoke Cú Cvlaind: 'Alas!' he said, 'they have cast Aiffi and her two hands into the pit of the wolves.' Aiffi fell to the ground. Cú Cvlaind struck her in the side with his sword and took from her the two arms and the shoulder, and then they dragged them across the plain, while Cú Cvlaind fought against a wild beast which was by him, until he overcame it, and he gave the beast to Aiffi's people for their burial and for the weapons of the warriors. Then said Aiffi: 'O my soul, O my soul, O Cú Cvlaind!' she said. 'My threefold wound is upon me,' said he. 'I have been wounded in three places,' said she. 'It was three wounds,' said he, 'which Scathach inflicted on her without giving her any revenge after that, and which I suffered for your sake in the battle with the men of Dunchad and with the sons of Mac Damm.' 'You are my beloved,' said she. 'Let it be known that you were so.' Then went Cú Cvlaind to Aiffi, and he took from her the head of this woman. Then spoke afterward to her: 'You are a monster and the daughter of a demon,' she said, 'and I will make you suffer for seven years in Erin.' And she said, 'And I shall give your name out.' Cú Cvlaind made a vow that he would not return to Erin until the land was full of gold, and that he would announce it throughout the world with his voice when the land was full of gold, and that its name should be given as the name of Conlui, and that it should be proclaimed that none should ever understand the language of infernal beings nor should they speak in the tongue of infernal beings, nor should they be able to make a shield from the materials of infernal beings</response>

=== === [RESPONSE] : <think>  </think>  <response>Roboi dano in that council, a certain man was alive, namely seven years and not engendered, but born from the seed of women, namely not hearing Christ's preaching to the Jews. He made a great law before the people, and he wrote it down in a book and sealed it with wax in the manner of the Druids. Namely, Jesus Christ, son of God, was born without sin. 'What is this?' said Conall to the Druid. 'What great evil has been done in this generation?' 'It is from the east,' said the Druid. 'That is a great law,' said Conall.

=== === [RESPONSE] : <think>  </think>  <response>And after that Conall said: 'I will give the men in my company to battle against the Jews who have crossed with Christ's name, if I may be able to fight against them.' Then they were seized and dragged forth by the assembly of the clergy and the bishops of Mesgeagra from their midst and Concubur the scribe. The sons of the Gaedhil and Concubur the scribe would have brought a great number of men to the assistance of the Irish, if it had been possible for them to fight with him. And in that place Conall's soul was taken to the company of Christ against his will, because of the pride of his soul. Finid</response>

The matter of that was discussed. Ethaid went into the assembly in the morning and took with him his weapons, and he said to them, 'Let me go, for Cet who was in the army of the Messengers was killed yesterday.' Every battle and every war which was not agreed upon by the Connacht men against Ulster, Cet would be in the assembly of those who were under the king's command, taking the third part of the plunder from the Ulstermen for their dead</response>

Óengus ua Dimmae Chróin was the most numerous man among them; the rest of the clans were not equal to him in numbers. Afterwards, a meeting was held with Óengus Huí Máil, and it was agreed that his meeting should be held first. It is said that Huí Máil had three hundred men under him; but Óengus had only three noble men from them.

She went to meet him for a fight against her father and her mother's kinsmen in Galway. Her father, who was old, fell before him by the hand of his son. 'Good,' said the woman, 'my assembly is with me tonight. But there are three hundred men of war and they will not be able to pass through the night, but they will be able to pass through the good ones among them. You shall have all my wealth for this victory, and you shall say that it was I who did it and that she was in her house and he was in the house, and she fell by a spear.'</response>

'Cosmail my life,' said Oengus, 'and not to kill for six. No one will be killed by them.' 'My son,' said the old man. With a clean blade I cut off the heads of the women and gave each of them their own head and they went forth in sorrow. 'There was food,' said she, 'in my house. My daughter and the girl herself were slain.' And thus they found the corpse on that day when they were there. Then afterwards Oengus and Aithechda made a pact between them</response>

It is your true name that is known to none but the beloved.' 'I am the warrior, and I chase the beautiful; every one [who] sings of me, does not know my true name.'

=== === [RESPONSE] : <think>  </think>  <response>They said that, indeed, Óengus was in the ambush of the people of Aithechdai and he was struck with a spear through his body. (It was not Dubchrón who killed Óengus at that time.) Then a man from the household of the king of Aithechda came forward, holding a red spear in his hand, and the people of Aithechda came after him to fight alongside them (i.e., into the place of Óengus) so that three men would be slain together. They afterwards severed his head and carried it off for his blood and for his garment over his head. Dubchrón was then killed by Dubglais, i.e., by his own hand. 'Throwing, Dubchrón,' said he. 'Not at all,' said Dubchrón. 'What is Óengus?' 'He is in the fortress; sit, sit, on that which does not disturb you. Throwing and throwing this thing.' 'I will not throw his fortress unless it be with a man who would carry it off. Take the garment from him,' said he. He took it. 'Truth, Óengus,' said he. And he said: 'Deibhid to his people what is white according to the condition of the fight; indeed, they have thrown the head of Óengus before them</response>
