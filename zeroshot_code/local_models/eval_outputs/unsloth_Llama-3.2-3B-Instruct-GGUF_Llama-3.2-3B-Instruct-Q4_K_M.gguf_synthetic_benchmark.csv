They say that Conall and Coinculaind and Lóegaire were there. “I have slain you” said Conall “with my spear against your neck.” But it was not from Ulster that they came, but from the land of the nobles, to avenge their lord, who had been killed by the enemy in battle, and to take revenge on the people for their slaughter, and to avenge their lord's death. And so the nobles in the imbarbáig or comrama did not spare them, but slew them with their swords, and took their bodies to the land of the dead","They brought a great beast from Ulster to fight on the plain of Fúait, and they were armed with mighty spears and shields. It is said that Conall and Coinculaind and Lóegaire. “You have killed me” said Conall “I was struck by the spear of the enemy in my back from the side of the shield.” But it was not from Ulster that the beast came, but rather from the land of the enemy, to be used as a war-horse for the nobles of the army.

Conal [the] son of the Goidel spoke against the Concubur, saying he would do a great deed for Ireland, lest both his life and his head be taken.

There was one of them: they took from the cattle of Osairge, not Mac Connaid each or Marccán or Oengus. Oengus son of Dimma Cron ro became a bigger cow; the maidens had been taken away by him alone. I think it is for Oengus Huí Máil and that he would take them with him. There was one among them: three hundred were their portion; but fifty of Oengus' were better than three of Marcán's, or of Hui Máil's.

The dogs have eaten them.” “My son is,” said the woman, “and soon I will be left alone with my husband and our children. We will die together. And so they died that day in that place. Oengus and Aithed each mourned their own line of descendants","They are not dead, the cattle of mbatar are immune to the plague.

The horses ran away.” “My daughter is,” says the woman, “and soon will be. We had to leave quickly, for the enemy is at hand and we fear we shall be slain. “We need food now,” says she, “in order to fight again. My son and I are ready for battle ourselves. And tomorrow will see what that will bring. Oengus and his men will be hungry soon.”","The man was drunk, the dogs were howling without him, his wife is crying, 'Oengus my son? Is Oengus?' 'My heart is cold,' said Oengus, 'no one dies for a wild ox. The hounds have released them.' 'My only child,' said she to him, 'Soon I will be left behind and do not see you again. My sons are dead, and we are two to die together. 'We will eat together in the other world,' said his wife, 'in the same battle as the rest of us. My sons and our family have all died.' Oengus' heart was cold that day at what had happened. Do not mourn Oengus and Aithnechda for their wives"
"A Colmán in Ireland is a beautiful place. Is it your home? The green hills are yours. In the mendocan land I dwell; and my cattle are fed on the grass. Mendocán is my dwelling, and the land of my inheritance; each of them [the men] has their own domain. It is my domainess","It is in the land of the chieftains with Colman and the rest of the people, that I say to you: 'Is it in Ireland that a man is noble? Is it not your own kinship?' 'A nobleman in Ireland. And what is the law for me? Each one [of us] has his own lord; there is no lord over my domain' 'It is my lady' he says 'my own servant'. 'I have taken this woman' to Colmán 'and I have given her to Aen.'","It's Colmán, the man with the red hair",The Lord of Ireland is at my right hand in the kingdom of Colman and with the raven I am told
"He is a great son. The little lord of the people of Cluana Eoch, son of Aengus, was killed at the ford. He was killed by Aengus' own hand, for he had been struck on the head with an axe by the lord in his anger. The lord was angry with him so Colman said to Aengus: 'Give me a ransack of your treasures'","He is a great son. He has killed the lord of Cluanae and Ech Aene at Cúlann's well, with his spear. He has taken the lord to Ech Aene's corpse, where he found the lord's head on his own body. The lord was there when Colmán said: 'Give me a drink from the well of Ech Aene","It was true that a little king of Cluanae had died on the field with his chariot. The little king had been killed by Aeneas' men, who took one of the king's horses for their own. It is said that the king was there when Colman came to take him. “Tell me what happened to Aeneas” Colman said",He was a great son. He killed a little man of Clan Ech Aene on the mountain where he found a boar. He killed that man of Aene and brought back his head to his lord with a long knife. The lord is angry at him on this business; “I gave you a ram for your father” said Colman
"They came to the king's court before Aeneas and took the oath: 'My son Laigse was great in the midst of the army; it is great to go with the host. The cow in the chariot was fat.' 'Is that a cow?' said Aeneas: 'it is not a cow at all.' 'I do not know what you mean,' replied Aeneas and Colman",King of the foreigners came to Aeneas and took his rudder: 'My son Laigse was very great in the midst of the people; it is much better to go with the multitude. The fawn in the forest became tame.' 'Is that a promise' said Aeneas: 'I do not make any promises except for oaths.' That was said by Aeneas and Colman,"Adam was the first man created by God, and he gave him an apple; a man of the court came before God and took the apple: “My son Laigse is very good in hunting with a bow; it's great to walk on a white deer; I am glad for this” said Adam: “I do not desire more than what is necessary.” replied God: “It was not my will that you should have such power and wisdom” said God, to Adam and Colman","A great lord has come to Ireland with his host and took the land: 'My son Laigse was much greater than the head of cattle; the greatest is to walk on the milked calf'.“Is fuba immoro” said Eneach: “I do not wish to be free from my forts, except my oxen.”The great lord had heard such an account as to meet between Eneach and Colman"
"They say that Oengus had a dream about the people of Athechda and that he was afraid for them, because they were being killed by men on both sides. (Not that Dubchroin was killed by Oengus in the same place.) I will tell you about my own eyes and my own head and the children of Athechda who are still alive ((i.e., in the house of Oengus)) until there is no one left to speak of.

(It is not a blow from Dubchrón, son of Engus, in that place.) May my spear be swift to strike my enemies' eyes and my sword be swift to strike their sides. And may the sons of Athechda be destroyed in it (i.e. in Engus) as if they were three times dead. Benait iarom a chenn de ocus do·berar hé for a dérgud ocus bratt dar a chenn.

And he brought a spear from his own hand and his own shield and the children of Athedach were afraid in it (i.e. in the chariot of Oengus) until there came three men carrying the bodies of the dead.

There was not a single man to stand against me on that side; my grey hair shone brightly in the sun and my white beard shone too, as well as the sons of Athéchda who were with me (that is, the chariot of Oengus), who had been killed. A little later I came upon it and found him to be a dead man. And I saw Dubhrón for Dubglais, that is, for my lord. “Tairling, Dubchróin,” he said. “I am not,” said Dubchrón. “Did you come from Oengus? ‘The dog has been caught; sit, sit, and do not let it run away. Tairling and I were in that house.’ “I did not kill his dog but if it was standing by him, I would have killed it,” said he. Then he said: “Fir, Oengus”, and then he told me to go on to the side of my dogs; in the valley of the hill for Oengus"
