"They say that I am a great warrior, and that my sword is as sharp as his, and that every man in the land of Suibhne has heard of me. 'I am the greatest of all warriors,' says Moling, 'for I have killed more men than any other in conversation with him at night. It was good luck to me that I met Suibhne. I.e. he is a warrior who has been slain on my own land, i.e. the land of Túath, which is called Gealtann, where there are no people and only darkness and silence. And I am the one who has killed all other men besides Suibhne,'; thus says Moling:","The devil has taken possession of my daughter, and she became like a bird in flight, and the stones were pulled out from under every man who came to her. 'The wolf is at the door,' said Moling, 'my son, do not be afraid, for I have been speaking with him before nightfall, and he has promised me that Suibhne will be safe until morning. I wish you well, my son, namely, that she should stay in this house, which is called Tuipreacht na Gealta, i.e., the house of the great lord, who was known as Tuipreacht, and his wife was called Notoimhledh, and their daughter was called Huisci. And I have been told that every other place is full of evil spirits; but I have not been afraid for Suibhne,' said Moling","When I was a young man, I came to Suibhne & I found a molehill there & I dug it up & I found a stone with a ring on it like his & every man who dug that hole found a piece of the sword of Suibhne. ‘This is the body of a warrior’ said Moling, ‘I have seen him in my dreams for many years & I saw him speaking to me about the end of the world so. I was glad when I found it, namely the sword on that stone which is called Tuipra, son of Gealt, his name, because he had a great spirit & a fierce heart & he was killed by an evil spirit & a wicked man & a woman also destroyed him; and I have seen every other terror like Suibhne’; then said Moling","Tú sé agóir, mo leannán Suibhnén, táimhnéll go mór dó chugat, & ar éirigh mé lonn agus aontaím cóireallach a bhfuil d'fháilte roimidh chun na haoibhinní ós tuiteáim é do thoirt do chroí. Go raibh maith agat don bhuachaill Íosa, go ndéanfar a gcuid goilleadh ar bhur áis déanta. & go ndeachtann sé a thugamhradh leat ina cros go dtuigeann tu a dhaoine é, go raibh tinteán deannaigh sé ar dhuine ós tuiteáim; & go bhfuil mé breithiúnach istigh do bheithidh mo chroí duit. Moltóin duit mo leannán Suibhnén"
"They will kill you, my boy, if you do not flee from the forest of the red deer today","They will kill you, my boy, if you do not flee from the forest of the red deer today","It will be your downfall, O brave man,' said Suibne, 'I shall not rest until I have killed you and taken the treasure of the golden deer that is bound to my arm in its beauty.' 'You will not escape me,' replied the boy, 'for it will be a great misfortune for me if I do not kill you.' 'By Christ, man,' said he, 'you will not find peace on earth or with any other man, until another man has killed you and taken the treasure of the golden deer from my hand. It is not right that one man should have it in his possession, while others are left without it to seek it.' 'Cursed be Christ upon you, O brave man,' said Moling, 'and may evil fortune follow you always & avert your head from the path of the wicked deed.' 'You will not escape my wrath,' replied Suibhne, 'until you have gone down into the underworld and there will be no rest for you.' 'I shall take you from this place,' said Moling, '.i. to bring you before me, & I will sing a song in your praise with three verses .i. Suibhne, Mongán & Moling",The boy was deceived
"They will be in the land of Connacht until they reach the hall of the king of All Fharanna, the land of Fíachrach Múaidhe; where the glen is green and the stream is swift, with a white wave that crashes on the shore, and a holy sanctuary and a place of refuge, where it was said to be there. And they will find a tree of strength in its midst, which bears great power and strength, and in his shadow they will find peace, for it is said that he found it there. A strong oak tree stood in the midst of them, with great power and strength, and in its presence they were filled with courage; and when they reached the shore of the great sea, they found it to be a place of refuge and a haven, where they would find rest, for it was said that they found it there. The house of Suibhne stood on the hill, so that he might take refuge and speak his words from the air; and thus the song says","They will not find it in the land of Connacht until they reach the hall of the great king of Munster, where the stream flows with silver and the road is paved with gold, and there is a holy well and a church standing on its banks; and it is said that the well was blessed by the All-Father, the Lord of Ireland, in the land of Fíachrach Mhúaidhe; and the glen is full of birds singing sweet melodies, the brook flows with crystal clear water, and the road is paved with stones of great strength, where the fairies dwell, and it is said that they are hidden there, for they have a strong magic, and no one has ever seen them, except those who have been to the great sea, which is full of wonders","When the sun sets over Suibhne's grave in Connacht, to the west of Hudmhall, it will be seen from the land of Fharanna, the land of Fíachrach Múaidhe; the glen is empty, the sound is silent, the noise is still, and the silence is complete, that there was no one there. The oak tree stands alone, its strength is great, its power is great, in that place there is a holy sanctuary & a place of peace, where they say it was there, even if I did not see it myself. There are trees standing strong, their greatness is great, and the power of the land is great, for it is a place of great strength & a refuge; may God have mercy on that soul, who perished there. The oak tree stood alone, its strength was great, its beauty was great, in that place, after a long journey from the great sea, which was all that remained of her","English translation of medieval Irish sentence is: In the shade of Suibhne's sheltered wall in Connacht to the west of Huddamhall, it was said that the land of Áth Fharáin would be fertile and pleasant until the All-Fairy kingdom would come into being; the glen's green streams, the raven's swift flight, the purple heather on the windy hillside, the wondrous fortress in a sacred grove & the fairies' dwelling place were there hidden away, for they dwelled there alone. A single oak tree stood tall, bearing strength-giving toils & a mighty trunk, it was said that a great fairy dweller had settled among them; the earth produced rich fruit & abundant crops, and in its shadow, a noble fortress stood. The noble Suibhne's house lay hidden behind the wall of the place, until he took refuge there and delivered his praise to the high spirits above; it is said that:"
"They say that Suibhne was in the cave of the hermit in Moling. I.e. The hermit's house. It is said that he had a psalter of St. Columba in his possession, and that it brought peace to all who heard its reading. They say that Suibhne was found in the hermit's lair in the cave, eating wild boar; 'That was my long life,' said the hermit; and Moling replied:","St. Suvain was buried in the church of Moling.I.e., the Church of Moling. That is, he had a psalter of St. Columba in the monastery of Moling and his soul was at peace with all those who were there. St. Suvain was found in the sraith of the tomb in the forest of the deer's clearing & he took up the body of the dead man. 'As my long life is, so I have been waiting,' said the priest; then Moling and Suibhne agreed","The devil Suibhne is hiding in the town of Moling. It is said that there was once a psalter of St. Columba in Moling, which was kept by many of the monastic community. The devil took Suibhne up to the heights of the tower and forced him to eat the flesh of a bird; 'This is my long life,' says the priest; then Moling told Suibhne this, and he replied","Suibhne will not be kept in the house of Moling until he has sung Psalms of Saint Kevin for his people. He was to be fed, and I shall give him bread, and he shall have meat; that is what I promised"
"As much as I am sorry for you, Shuibhne,' said Moling, 'there is a curse upon you & your family, your home & the famine that has driven you out, & the poverty in which you have been left to perish, & the death of your ancestors, & the loss of your land, & the shame of being a beggar in Ireland, every day without an end,' said Moling, 'a great burden is laid upon me for each of my children who has died in this house.'","As much as I am bound to my son, so is Shuibhne,' said Moling, 'so long as you are in that place & your soul will be saved there, your body will be preserved there, the famine will be averted from it, and the land will flourish, so great is the shire of Ireland for every man who has come to this place, until they have been buried there, and their souls will rest,' said Moling, 'a great blessing to each day.'","As much as I am sorry for your son, says Shuibhne,' says Moling, 'you have a blessing upon you to be there & good luck to your son, the road & the journey of your soul, & peace in relics of fire, and this fort,' says Moling, 'a great shire is every day for the people of Ireland, that it will be blessed with the light of our souls,'","Moloney said to Shovin,'Since the darkness of your house is upon you & the joy of your house is in the darkness, the shield of your defense fails & the immanence of your safety departs, and the fortress of your refuge is broken,' Moloney said, 'a great burden weighs each day on Erin's sons to be borne until it is sealed & silent, but for us who live at peace.'"
I will go to the geese in the evening; may they be with me at Moling,"Iomthuasa na geilte iarsin; robhaoi risin mbliadhain sin ag tathaighidh Moling.

May it bring prosperity to Inis Bó Finni in Connacht, may it bring peace to the Rúaidh, may it bring peace to Slíabh Mínálainn Mis, may it bring peace to the land of the Boirche; may God bless each day and every night with Moling's table.  Moling ordered a big feast for this occasion, and he was pleased that the cows were brought to him. Muirghil, the name of the fairy, because she was the cow that killed Moling. It is said that the beauty of her milk was not enough; i.e., the nodhingedh (a magical cow) that grazed under the shadow of a tree with its horns shining in the light of knowledge and full of wisdom to Suibhne. The gods are angry because of the slaughter of the white cows in the lake of the milk","I am going to kill my enemies this evening; I have gone out with Moling in the afterlife. She found a cow in the land of Innis Bó Finni in Connacht, and she didn't find any ruin in Rúaidh, nor did she find Slíabh mínaluinn Mis, nor did she see anything in Bendadh bhíofhúara Boirche; the very fact that they are found each day in the night by Moling's house; Moling had prophesied to bring forth this being with those two men, Muirghil and Mhungán. It is a wonderful sign, i.e., the cow was seen standing on one foot, looking up towards its back and surrounded with lemnachs who were full of wisdom in Suibhne's knowledge, and no fat was wasted in the feast of that river"
"They will be buried in the same grave as Muirghil & his wife, and the other man: ‘As to you,’ he said, ‘there is no touch of your fellow & yet not a touch of your own self in that highness which they have attained in this world; surely the castle there is beautiful & it would be a great pity if Muirghil were not to see it on his way to the abbey of Suibhne, for it was a pleasant place to dwell. Oh, dear brother, I am sure you will find that castle beautiful & it would be a great shame if Muirghil were not to see it on his way to the abbey of Suibhne, for it was a pleasant place to dwell. The boy took hold of that staff in his hand, and he became so proud & his hand trembled with fear as he went out to meet him & sat down beside him. And the youth said to him: ‘There is your brother in that grave, a great warrior.’ He looked at it & was filled with grief & rage at what had happened to him & to his own life; surely the castle there is beautiful & it would be a great pity if Muirghil were not to see it on his way to the abbey of Suibhne, for it was a pleasant place to dwell.

Oh, dear brother, I am sure you will find that castle beautiful & it would be a great shame if Muirghil were not to see it on his way to the abbey of Suibhne, for it was a pleasant place to dwell","They will be buried in the same grave as Muirghil & his wife, and they will not leave each other until the end of their lives: 'As to you,' he said, 'there is no touch of the other man & yet there is a touch between them.' They should certainly look at that place & it would be good for Muirghil if he were in the same bed as his wife on the way to Inis Mhic an Bhaird, because they will be companions in the boat. My brother is sure of that & he said to his brother: 'There is your sister in that grave, a great healer.' He was amazed at what she had said, and his hand trembled with fear as it reached out for the well & he went into it for water. As if the spirit & its companion were there waiting for him in the boat. I will give you both the same share of the land on your left hand, because I saw that the spirit was angry at Muirghil when he was dying on the way to Inis Mhic an Bhaird, which would be a good thing for the family. My brother is sure of that & he said to his brother: 'There is your sister in that grave, a great healer.' He was amazed at what she had said, and his hand trembled with fear as it reached out for the well & he went into it for water. As if the spirit & its companion were there waiting for him in the boat.

As if the spirit & its companion were there waiting for him in the boat","They were going to slaughter the ox in Mhuirghil and the women of Ulster, while the other men would be fighting, as he said: 'As for you,' he said, 'the touch of that other man is not good for you and yet it is not bad either.' Look carefully at that ox and see how much more peaceful it was when Muirghil was leading his cattle to the river in the morning, until they reached Suibhne's meadow which was most pleasant. My father surely saw that ox being led by a boy, & he took great care not to hurt him with his spear, as the boy was innocent and had not yet learned how to handle the spear. He put his hand on the ground beside him, & sat for a while in the shade of the meadow. As I looked at the boy holding that spear, I felt sorry for him & touched my hand on his shoulder, 'May God protect you,' he said. The youth was very angry and threw his spear to the ground with great force & ran towards it, as if he had been ordered to do so by the god; he took the spear up again & went back to the meadow. I told that boy to stand on the other side of the ox, lest he would fall into the water which was near Suibhne's meadow, for I feared he would drown in it. My father surely saw the boy standing beside him, when he said: 'The ox is being led by a boy, as if he were a priest.'","Muirghil will find no fault in the girl who is standing on that hill, for she is not like other girls of her kin, who are often driven to desperation by their husbands; she has a noble spirit and will not be brought low by the desires of men as long as she holds high her own dignity in the world"
"They will not be able to reach their home until they have crossed the river and reached the other side, & that their mother will know them there. Rofoillsigedh do Ronán an tan sin a chiall do tuidhecht do Suibhne & a bheith ag dul chum a thíre d'anadh eiter a mhuintir, co n-ébairt Rónán: ‘Aitchim-si an Rígh uasal uilechumhachtach nár fféde se an t-ingrinntidh sin do ionnsaighe na heagailsi dia hingreim doridhisi amail dorighni fecht n-aill & an t-inneachadh tuc Día fair a ndíogail a dhímhiadha-somh for a mhuintir ná raibe furtacht ná fóiridhin dhó dhe co roscara a anam fri a chorp, ar dháigh ná tiobhra a aithghin oile do ingrinntidh dia éis sár nó dímigin for an cCoimdigh nach for a mhuintir itir","They will not be able to reach their home until they have fought the battles of their ancestors, and it is Ronán who has taken Suibhne's place in his father's house, and he will go with them to their land, except that Rónán says: 'I am the king of all noble strength, who has not betrayed the memory of that kinship between the giants of old, which was lost in a long and bitter fight, and the alliance of the people. And I have given my word to Día fair, that they will not be driven out or forced to flee from their home, except that two men will remain, who are worthy of the memory of the gods, and not unworthy of the inheritance of the Coimdigh, which is not for the people alone.'","The king's son is in great danger, and the whole of Ireland is disturbed by it. It has caused my mother to be sick, and I am afraid that she will die. I have reported this to Ronán, who knows that the king's son was killed in battle with a great army, and with his people he is going to meet the enemy, but Ronán says: 'The Lord God of mercy will not forget our sins; for we have betrayed the weak and helpless one, and the innocent, whom we crushed with our feet; and when we shall be punished before His face, then shall it be clear that we are not worthy. And if we are not ashamed to do such a thing, and not sorry to have done so, then shall our souls be lost forever in hell, for our mother's sake, as well as for the love of her body, but they will not rest until they see the light of justice before their people, nor until they are punished by the Lord, lest they fall into the darkness and despair of the wicked","That's not my father he is dead, but the enemy of our lord took him away with deceit and treachery to his house and his family. That was the year that Ronan found out about Suibhne's death and was going to go to the field for his people & that they were not expecting it  except when Rónán said: 'The king is a great lord noble in strength I have never seen it in any marriage of that heavey weight  or heavy fighting   until one day at an assembly Día gave him a place to dwell with my family neither was there danger nor sorrow for his family and the man did not leave that place with a single thought about their well-being, nor did he go back  so I looked after them until they were safe"
"They said to the devil that they had met Suibne at the foot of Sléibh Fúaid's mountain and that he had told them that his mother was a woman without a soul, without flesh, without blood, without breath, without eyes, without ears, without tongue, without nose, without mouth. They said to each other: 'He is a devil,' on the first hill. 'A devil Ultach,' on the second hill. 'His mother was good,' on the third hill. 'It will be long for his mother,' on the fourth hill. 'Not long at all,' on the fifth hill. They were frightened by his story. The devil said to them: 'You will not see him again, unless you give me your souls. I will take it from each of you as you pass by every mountain today and much more than before when there was no one to hinder you, but now you have the fear in your hearts","They say that the Lord has chosen Rónáin, when he was but a child, that Suibhne would be brought to the top of Sléibh Fúaid, and that his head would be cut off in order to make a good offering to God, namely five hundred pounds of gold, without a single stain or blemish, without flesh, without blood, without entrails, without sin, without shame, and without fear. They say that they spoke with each other and it was said: 'He is a thief,' on the first hill. 'A robber Ultach,' on the second hill. 'A good man,' on the third hill. 'It will be long for him,' on the fourth hill. 'No one has seen fairer,' on the fifth hill. They say that Noseirgheatt, his daughter, was taken to him. The birds sang with joy over it. We repaid them in full, and we gave to each of our men what they had come for, and we took the road before them","They asked the road that was before Suibhne, how many had perished on it, and which had been killed by hunger alone & five of joyous deeds, without flesh, without blood shed, without strife, in peace & in quietness, on the plain of the waterfall, and on the slope. They said to each other: ‘Dead is he,’ on the first hill. ‘Dead Ultach,’ on the second hill. ‘Well-fed is it,’ on the third hill. ‘Long was its feeding,’ on the fourth hill. ‘No joy in it,’ on the fifth hill. They praised his ancestor for him. They said to each other: ‘He is a great warrior.’","Come, Lord Rónáin, when we were poor, Suibhne hid her body on the slope of Sléibh Fúaid because she was afraid it would attract attention and shame to our house & her household; namely ten lepers who did not have a home or a wife, blind, without children, in exile & in longing for our land & its sovereignty & all. They asked each other during the conversation: ‘A eilt,’ (is he) on the hill. ‘Gelt Ultach,’ (he is) on the second hill. ‘A lenmhain co maith,’ (she has a good husband) on the third hill. ‘Gurab fada an lenmhain,’ (the husband was long ago) on the fourth hill. ‘Nógo ría fairrge,’ (there was no one before) on the fifth hill. Nightingale of our family came to it. They cried out: “O God’s mercy!” A prayer was said over them & they mourned all that had gone before but we did not know what the lord gave us & so I blessed for ourselves for a time"
"May the road rise up to meet you, may the wind be always at your back, may the sun shine warm upon your face, and the rains fall soft upon your fields, and until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of his hand, may he keep safe all who love you, and all who open their hearts to you, I'll be thinking of you every step of the way, and praying for you always, until we meet again, may no storm cloud darken your path, nor shall any sorrow stay your way, may God hold you in the palm of his hand, may he keep safe all who love you, and all who open their hearts to you","The world is in darkness and chaos, but the light of Christ will guide us through the turmoil and tribulations that lie ahead","When the darkness falls, the trees will stand firm, the rocks and hills, the sea and all that lies beneath them, will be shaken by the thunder and the lightning, but they will not be broken, for they are rooted in the earth and in the heavens, and will bear the weight of every storm and every turmoil, and all the winds and rains, and the rustling of leaves and the creaking of trees, and the crashing of waves against the rocks and the hills, and the howling of the wind, until nothing remains but a heap of wreckage","Certainly the darkness shall not overcome you, but with my help, your enemies will be crushed, and you will triumph over them"
"It was a beautiful evening in the spring when I went to the well of the fairies and the cenn of the cone, where the sound of the bádar sidhe was heard from afar, near the hill of the Oileán ina lenmhuin. It was not an evil spirit that had been there before, for it did not disturb the earth with its presence, nor did it bring any harm to those who dwelled in the three hills against it, until the night of the fairies came down from the top of Sléibhe Eidhneach, Aidneach, which was hidden behind a wall that closed on that night, and the darkness. He had been there for a long time; he said:‘Olc éimh atáthar agom anocht a haithle na caillighe & na ccenn ar Slíabh Fúaid,’ he said, ‘but I am not as good as my own counsel;’ and he spoke thus","There was a great slaughter in the land of Éirinn, and a multitude of men were slain by the side of the well of Cennétta, where the fairies dwelled, for they had been driven out from their homes before that time, when there was no shelter for them to take refuge in, nor food, until they found a place to rest in the top of Sléibhe Éidhneach, Aidneach, which was not far from the shore of the sea, where the night fell; and he was weary:‘Olc éimh atáthar agom anocht a haithle na caillighe & na ccenn ar Slíabh Fúaid,’ said he, ‘but I have no food in my house, nor in my field, until I find myself a place to rest;’ and he spoke thus:","The devil is in the details of our own nature and the darkness within ourselves that was present before this night, when no one dared to confront it three times in front of us, until the full moon rises over the summit of Sléibhe Éidneach, Aidneach, which has been waiting patiently against its return, to bring forth an evil: “Olc éimh atáthar agom anocht a haithle na caillighe & na ccenn ar Slíabh Fúaid,” said he, “but my heart is as coarse as the stones on Sléibh Fúaid;” and he spoke thus","There will be no winter where there are no wolves and the hounds of hell cannot reach it until it has been tested in three trials in its defense, when one afoot reaches the top of Sléibhe Eidhneach, Aidenech that is found only in the morning, before the night takes control; great is my sorrow:“Olc éimh atáthar agom anocht a haithle na caillighe & na ccenn ar Slíabh Fúaid,” he said, “but there will be as much evil from within me as I have done outside, until I am purified;”"
"They say that Suibhne was taken to the land of the dead in Luachair Dheadhadh for a burial; he had a great longing for the beauty of the green hills and the glen of Gaible. The soul of that man & his father were in the body, until this very day .i. the cow with the curved horns & the deer with the dark coat & the dog with the loud barking, .i. the river from the name of the land, the hill, where you would find a great stone & a bronze door, and that was the dwelling of Suibhni in the end of that year, and it is said that he sang this song:","They will be taken from the land of Sweeney in Lough Derg for a great and wondrous miracle; it was said that he had a vision of a white horse going to the west of the plain of Gaible. The soul of that man & his father were carried away before him in that year .i. a corriga of crúandatha with a cow of dubhdhuinne & a dog of the sea, .i. the river from the name of the plain, where he was taken to be seized for that crime  and he heard the song of the big man:","They brought Suibne to Lough Derg for the sake of a burial; there was a great anxiety in his heart that he would not be found until the end of that winter. I. He had a vision of our Lord, with his hands and feet bound, and his eyes closed, & his breath drawn out of him. I. The Lord God gave us the power to bring him over from the lake, so that we might have a safe passage, for he was taken from the earth at the end of that winter, .I. the Lord God gave us the power to speak the words of the psalm: 'O wondrous works, declared in wisdom, that are told by thy testimony!'","The women of Ireland are singing for Suibhne in Loch Dheadhadh; he was taken into the care of wise men and learned many strange things from that fish; his soul was then freed by a great corvus, and he was led to it by the stream of the fish, until there he took refuge and hid, i.e. there we find the corvus, which is on the back of the fish, and Suibhne's burial was there, in the fort of the sea, where he hid to avoid the people, and there he declared a mighty song"
"It was Suibhne who killed the hound in the king's house on the hill of the plain, and he said: ‘Woe to me. That is, O Ireland,’ he said, ‘I have slain a beast like myself.’ ‘Indeed,’ said Ireland, ‘you are coming near.’ ‘Not for me,’ said Suibhne, ‘for there was no host in the assembly of the toghaigh form.’ ‘To me it seems’ said the woman, ‘no good will do you & if you did not have a chariot with you & were not dear to you, we would not have seen that beast for our own cattle. That is what we saw when we found your footprints in our own field.’ ‘Wretched thing this,’ said Suibhne, ‘and it grieves me much on the side of women after those words. When I was well-pleased with the woman who was fair and wise, I thought to myself that there would be a hundred cows & a hundred calves, & that we would have found that beast in our own cattle; but now that Oilill Cédach, king Ua fFhaoláin, has been killed, it seems to me that we will not see it again.’","It was Suibhne who killed the king in his bed in the fort of the woman's husband, and he said: 'Woe to you. That is, I am your enemy,' he said, 'I will take your life.' 'Indeed,' said the king, 'and you are coming near,' he said. 'Not for me,' said Suibhne, 'because it was not the host of the assembly that killed him in the place of the togha.' 'To my mind,' said the woman, 'no one will do harm to you and from not being your enemy,' she said, 'we will not be at enmity with each other, as we have not seen such a slaughter among the people of the land; that is why I am glad for what has happened to you.' 'Woe to me' said Suibhne, 'as much sorrow will come over us after those words. When was it good my thinking on the woman who was most beautiful in the assembly, with eight cows and eight oxen, and on the day of Oill Cédach, king of Ua fFhaoláin, a great slaughter occurred; thus she said from above","It was Suibhne who died in the ditch that he had dug in Eorann's territory on the bank of the ford of his wife's house, where he said: ‘Woe to you, Eorann,’ he said, ‘you have killed my flesh and blood.’ ‘Indeed,’ said Eorann, ‘it is near,’ he said. ‘I do not regret it,’ said Suibhne, ‘for the host of the assembly did not find him in the ditch after his death.’ ‘To me,’ said the woman, ‘no sorrow does it bring to any of you & neither will I be angry with you, for we have not seen that foul thing myself, and it is a wonder to us that such a beast was found in our own land.'","It's my sister Suibhne who has been killed in the battle of Eorann against the men of fordhorus at the fort of her father, the king, and he says to them: ‘Victory! That is I, Eorann,’ he says, ‘I have killed a man-slayer.’ “As it's true,” says Eorann, “it's coming near,” he said. “No one is sorry for me,” says Suibhne, “for the host did not turn back from the high fort.” “Because of that,” says the woman, “no doubt do you feel about each one to whom you have turned against, and it will be between us and them, in that we were unable to see the slaughter of those slaves, who perished in your own fortress.” “Woe is me” says Suibhne, “and my heart does not turn towards men after those words. When I was confident of my comeliness with a man of my kind, which I was at Oilill Cédach, king Ua fFhaoláin, that was well seen by me; and so he said it to us,”"
"As the sun rises over the plain of Craebruad Concoboir, I see the midland men with their spears, and we are not far from the fortress of Midhcordai. We will not be delayed by the noise of the battle. The threefold host of the airdechu will stand firm against the enemy's army. Still they will come to this place in the morning & take shelter under the hill above. I have Concoboir, the lord of the airienech, in the fortress with his men, who are waiting for a signal, ready to fight with their armor, coming from afar, like a stormy cloud and a whirlwind. In no way will Concobor be defeated by the enemy's army, and Ulaid will rise up against them","As the sun rises over the plain of Cruithne Concobor, I am in the midst of Midhordai. We are not far from the fort. Three hundred men with noble crests stand before me. The king's standard and the banner of our lord are still there. In the fort of Concobor the Irish are gathered to celebrate a great festival, to feast on meat, to drink wine, to make music, to sing sweet songs, and to dance in joy. And I am noble Concobor with the right hand of the king, over Ulaid until the end of time","When the great Boi in Tech Soin was slain by the sons of Craebrecc Concoboir, Midhcorda's kin took refuge within him. We did not take our lord from that place. Threefold was the darkness of the night, and the day broke forth with a light. Still he stood upright in the morning & his slumber was on his back. The great Concobor took the airineach in the fort, with a strength of faith, with a courage to make war for an end, with a might of arms in it, with a beauty to behold, with a soul to be free, and with a voice that could be heard throughout the land. In the night there was no peace within me, nor was I at ease in my mind, nor was I in my heart","God is with you always, and he will never leave you or forgo you, not even when you are beset on every side. For this reason we make the sign of the cross to invoke his presence with us always. Three times a day we say these prayers to our Lord, that we may be protected from all evil, both present and future, through his power which is beyond compare, glorious and holy. The people of Ulaid are told that he came into this world as a child, was born in Bethlehem, went down with the Magi to worship him, gave him milk to eat, bread to sustain him, and clothes for warmth. And when he had been crucified on the cross, it is said that he descended into Hell, in order that He might free us from our sins"

There was no one more cunning than the lord of immorrog and laith of Gailie, over Ulster, and he has taken the head of Emoin. By the hand of three warriors, he has destroyed many, a great warrior, and a wise man","There was a great multitude from Ulster and the people of a noble king were slain at Cnoc Meadha, because there was no one to protect them from the ravage of war and pillage"
"The men of Ulaid fought against the people of Emuin Machie in a great battle. The men of the lion were not found among the nobles. But they were found in the land of Ultu, who had been driven out by the sons of Ulad from their own house and Emhoin. They came to Ireland with a single ship and an island as their refuge. And they settled in the south of the land","The men of Ulaid fought against the people of Emuin Machie in a great battle. The best warriors were killed by the Cechi, who were not to be defeated. They were on the side of the gods. This was foretold by Ultu, who said that the Ullidmen would take over the fortress of Emhoin. The people of Ulaid took their arms and went out to war. Three hundred men died in the battle","The people of Ulaid fought against the men of Emuin Machie in the war with England. Some of their brothers were killed by the English lions. They were not able to get it out of the forest. The Ulaid are very sad about this. Not all of our lords are dead, but some are still alive. We will be avenged for this. The men of Ulaid are in great pain and Emhoin is angry","Ced's son was killed at Emo, and his body taken to Dublin. But his sons are alive. They took the king of Ulster's lands by force. The great Ulaid, son of Donal Ua Eochadaig, died in battle. His people were slain at Suainemnaib. His sons will avenge him from Emo into England. He will take the kingship and be lord of Dublin"

"Seven times the strength of Cúchulainn was broken in that day: namely, when he was wounded by a spear, when his thigh was cut, when his knee was struck, when his foot was kicked, when his head was beaten, and when his back was lashed. Seven times he recovered from those wounds: namely, when the wound on his thigh healed, when the wound in his knee did not become infected, when the wound on his foot did not cause him to stumble, when the wound on his head did not make him dazed, and when the lash on his back did not cause him pain. Three times Cúchulainn was struck: namely, by a spear thrust into his side, by a blow from a club that broke his arm, and by a blow from a sling that shattered his hand","The seven virtues of Cú Chulainn are: prudence, justice, temperance, fortitude, generosity, patience, and humility","Seven times the strength of Cú Chulainn was taken away from him, namely: that his right hand was broken, his left arm was wounded, his breast was pierced, his back was beaten, his head was struck, and his neck was bent.

Three times was Con Cú Chulaind defeated: namely, that the red hand of Cú Chulainn was broken, that his right arm was wounded, and that his left hand was bent","Cúchulainn slew Ulaid's prince and took the princess captive. He cut off his foot and threw it away. That was his right, for he had but one eye to look at, only one to see beyond it. Seven of his wounds were still open, namely a palm to his palm, three fingers of his hand severed, a thumb from his right hand, seven toes of his right foot cut off, seven wounds on his chest and seven wounds in his head"
"When the great wolf Cú Chulainn was slain by Sétanta, a man and a woman came to mourn over him, for there was no one set free from the grief of Cú Chulainn's death in the burning house. For it is said that Sétanta had killed Cú Chulainn with a poisoned spear, and both men were covered in blood and service to their women and daughters were hindered by the sorrow of his death, and it was so said that the lord of the red hand was angry at the slaughter of men in the burning house, for they had been slain without cause. And there was no one who could avenge Cú Chulainn's death, except for the women of Ulster, for they were noble and wise in their grief","When the great hero Cúchulainn was in the midst of his battle with the armies of Queen Medb of Connacht, a man and a woman came to his aid, for there were many men set free by the death of Cúchulainn's father, Sétanta, and they had come to avenge him, and it was said that if one killed Cúchulainn in his chariot, he would be avenged by the women of Connacht, for they were fed up with the slaughter of men on the plain, and they vowed to avenge their lord's death, and it is said that the women of Connacht will not rest until they have killed all the men who are in the plain today, and they will be avenged by the blood of Cúchulainn","My friend Cúchulainn, I have killed a man and a woman together, for there is no one to stand by Cúchulainn the son of Lugh, except that my spear is wounded, so I will be taken captive by Coin Culaind the son of Lir, unless I kill a hundred men with my spear, and serve a thousand women in this army and make them my wife and give birth to setig, and it is so said that I was born from a woman who was killed by a man, and that is the reason for my being unable to come out of this cave until I have killed a hundred men with my spear, unless I am fed on the flesh of men, because there are no women in the army to give me food or drink, and I am so hungry that I will be able to eat nothing but the flesh of men","He killed the man and his wife, at night, on the eve of Conculaind's wedding, because he was afraid that setig would kill Conculaind with a spear at the head of the trench, where there was one blacksmith to make an iron sword for the women and for himself, but he saw death to all men and his daughter who was being taken by the servant; and it was as if my mother had been killed suddenly , because they found him on the eve of her burial in the pit with a dead man, and the son said that the father had cut them off at the head of the trench to get rid of them, and he fled alone, before anyone saw the dead men, and so was his fate"

"At Cú Chulainn's feast, he was given another gift by Lugaidh Loga, son of Forcailt Mochu, and Emer gave him the sword of Láech mac Ríengairpéit in his carput.

They took the field with Cúchulainn & Lucc mac Riangaprai in their chariot.

Cú Chulaind and his wife had a son named Comadus in their house & they were of the nobles of Erin and of the nobility. And it is said that the kings of Ireland did not know them. Is this the end of the story of Cú Chulaind","For the sake of Cú Chulainn, in a foreign land, with a bitter lament and a heavy heart, I am son of the great warrior, in Dun Forgaill. But I swear on the side of the forest, and the sacred grove, that I will not betray my lord & noble Emir. It is for this reason that I have come to Ireland, to call upon the gods of Erin, to avenge my kin & my people. And it is for this reason that there are nine oaths sworn by me, namely: the oath of the broad sword & the oath of the spear, the oath of the binding, the oath of the forest, the oath of the goise, and the oath of the generosity. May Cú Chulainn avenge his lord & my people, with strength & courage & honor & fame, for I have sworn to the gods of Erin, that I will not betray my lord's trust & noble kin. And it is for this reason that I am bound by the oaths of the nobles","Cú Chulaind and his wife were playing at a game with a ball in the house of Dun Forgaill. She was a great warrior, son of a brave man, in Éirinn. There are seven kinds of bravery: the bravery of the body, the bravery of the mind, the bravery of binding, the bravery of the spear, the bravery of the goad, the bravery of the bow, and the bravery of the sword. The great Cú Chulaind had his wife play with a ball in her hand and at the feet and knees and belly and head, as if she were a lamb; and he would not let them be taken away from him to serve Éirinn, or to be sold to strangers. And it is said that this was an omen of great good for Cú Chulaind","For Cú Chulaind, we will play in the game with a hundred strokes of the sword until the sun sets over the fort of Dun Forgaill and the men of Emir are broken"
"Cu Chulaind said to the air of Scathaig that he would not be able to eat in peace until he had killed all the men who were with Cúchulainn, and when they asked him what was wrong, he replied: 'I am hungry!'

He said: 'Enough, I have eaten' & laughed. There was no one left in the house who could be afraid of him","They killed Cú Chulainn in the airmb of Scathaig, and he was taken to the bordaib with cloideb and bretha, and they said: 'He has been slain!' said one. 'To avenge his death', said another, 'I will kill that Scathaig!' 'Let us go!' said Cú Chulaind. For it is now that I am born in Ireland, and I will not be killed by any man, for I have the strength of every man on my side, and I will avenge myself: 'I will kill him, that Scathaig!' & so. And there was no one left to hinder them from doing so, since they had been silent about this evil deed","Cu Chulaind said to the hero Scathaig in the midst of battle: 'There is no one more valiant than you!' he exclaimed. 'You are truly a noble man', he added, 'you have a face that can calm the savage beast, and your breath is warm as fire.' 'By my spear!' said Cu Chulaind. For I am not yet twenty years old. Is it well known throughout Ireland that Cu Chulaind Scathaig will be slain tonight? He was informed of this by a woman in the crowd, who whispered to him: 'There is no one more treacherous than you!' and he replied. There are no such people as these in the world, I swear it on my spear","Cu Chulaind broke the belt of Scathaig in one bound and struck him on the breast with his sword, saying 'This is a traitor!' The treacherous Scathaig replied: 'I will take you for that' & then said: 'Enough!' exclaimed Cu Chulaind. He was not at all angry; but he thought to himself that the man was of such a kind that none should ever be able to tell him what had happened, so quiet was his face and so gentle were his words, so that no one suspected anything out of it ."

For the heart of Scathach was not to be found anywhere, neither in the land nor in the sea. Only one had seen it, namely that Scathce, who had been slain three times and had been given as a gift to Aiffe, and he alone knew that it was his own domain","They brought the head of Laeg's son to Scathach at her stronghold in Connemara, one of three sons of Ilsvanagh. Cuar and Cet and Cruifne were among the three who slew Aifi. They took their share and divided it. The warrior took his share from the sword of the man with the red hair, and he was granted a gift by the goddess Scathach, for she had not rejected him as one who did not kill. Lotar brought three sons of Esse Enchinne and Cirí and Birí and Bailcne, three men who slew Aifi and were praised for their bravery. They took the head of Laeg's son to the king. The head was taken from Scathach's stronghold in Connemara, for it was not one that she had rejected as unworthy, but rather one that was granted to her by Aife, a goddess, for the gift was great and the offering was acceptable. Lvid 'div Cu Chulaind brought Laeg's son to him from his mother and he did not know what to do with it, and so he gave it back to Aife","The children of Laeg's wife are three sons of Scathqu, namely Cuar and Cet and Cruifne; Aifi has nine thousand men, and a third part of them is sick. They set out with their one hundred knights in the red battle on the plain of the black ditch. Lotar, three sons of Esse Enchinne, Cirí, Birí, Bailcne, nine thousand men, swift as the rivers of Aifi and the horses of his companions, bore the standard before him. The red cloaks of Scathach shine like a shield in front of them, and they are not found until the fight is won or lost. All will be the same when he falls, just as it was with Aiffe; for though he has good men, he cannot save himself from death, and his wealth will be of no use to him"

We are in danger of losing our children to hunger and thirst, if we do not provide for them. Our women are crying out for food and clothing, and the people are dying of starvation.

"Cu Chulainn killed the stag of the lord and slew his father's steed as well, for he was a great warrior. He killed the wild boar of Conoll & Lægairi. The people thought him to be a murderer of the Fomorians, but they did not believe in him or his kin. The sons of the king and their wives were afraid of him & fled from him whenever they could. Cu Chulainn took refuge in the cave & hid the stag's head. 'Do-m-beur the stag's head', said Ruad, '& I myself will make a necklace.' 'I will', said Cu Chulaind. 'I will take the stag's head to Ireland for a hundred years and bring back its meat.'","Cu Chulaind took the spear from his father and chose Ulidh. He took the spear of Culann from the people, for every dog was a killer. The dogs of Colla and Lugh were killed. It is said that he slew the Fomorians alone, but did not kill their children. The sons of the king and his wives were safe as long as they were in his sight. Cu Chulaind took the spear again and struck the people with it and was known far and wide. ‘Do-m-beur the spear to me’, said Ruad, ‘and I will give you my own shield.’ ‘I will not’, said Cu Chulaind. ‘It is not a gift of a year's peace to Ireland for one day and a truce for a month’s mess,’”","Cu Chulainn asked the goddess of the underworld to avenge his father's death and kill all the giants. Cu Chulaind was chosen by Lugh, the god of light, to be the champion of Ireland against every enemy. He slew many giants, including Conall and Lægairi. We believe that this deed will not bring him death at the hands of the Fomorians, but rather their own destruction. The gods have given him strength and he has avenged his father's death with great renown. ‘We have taken the goddess from you’, said Ruad, ‘and I have taken her myself.’ ‘I have done it’, replied Cu Chulaind. ‘It took me seven years to kill each of them in Ireland’s land and to bring peace to our people","Those of the tribe have killed my father and the dogs, those of the tribe kill every child, they have slain Coll and Láeg. The enemy's women weep for him, though none believe it. We are slaves to our lord & his wife every day, till he gives us leave. I killed a deer and found an arrow in me. ‘Do-m-beur my arrow’ says Ruad, ‘& I made myself lame.’ ‘I am,’ says Cu Chulaind. ‘Those of the tribe slaughtered three years of my life for me on my way to Ireland from Spain & brought me back.'"
"It was Cú Chulainn who killed Aithne in Emain Macha and took her head as a spoil of war. He had been waiting for that moment all his life, and now he would take the kingdom of Forcail from the Emir. The people were long overdue for their freedom & they would not be held back by the fear of the foreign invaders. It is time to rise up, O Léig, and drive out Ruaid, although I know that my father will not let me do it, because he fears the stranger. 'We must take our land back', he says, 'for the king's sake.'","It was Cú Chulainn who killed Aithne in Emain Macha and took her head as a spoil of war. He had been told not to do so, but he did take the head of Forcail for his lord Emir. The year was long past when they were at peace with the Fomorians. It is said that Cú Chulainn would often say 'I am king, and this is my kingdom,' and that he would not be defeated by any man","It is Cú Chulainn's fate to be slain in Ulster and his body will not rest until Forannach has dug a grave for him. May the days of his youth remain with him & may he not feel any pain from this wound, which is like that of a wild boar in the midst of war.

"Cu Chulaind threw the stone at Locha Quan iarum's head, but it missed him for a fish in the sea. The man who had killed Cu Chulaind was Derbforcaill ingen Rvaid and his wife. 'You are a murderer, Cu Chulaind!' he said. 'I will not be silenced, I am one of those who have been wronged.' So Cu Chulaind threw the stone at the woman's foot, saying 'I will not forgive you', 'for the fish'. He turned to his servant Lugaid Reondercc and said 'Let us go away from this place.'","They say that the bat flew over the lake of Lough Quan near the castle of Cu Chulaind, and it was caught by a man with a spear in his hand. The man had been waiting for years to catch one like this. In the meantime, he was eating alone, without any company. He said, 'I have killed a monster, Cu Chulaind!' 'It is not an easy task to kill a giant,' he replied. Cú Chulainn took the spear and threw it at the monster's foot. 'You will be rewarded for your bravery,' said Cu Chulaind, 'for you have caught one like this. I will give you my servant, Lugaid Reondercc.' And with that, he gave him the spear","Cu Chulainn threw the stone at Loch Quanier, which had fallen from the air of Lough Neagh into the sea. The man with the spear caught it and broke off its head. He ran quickly to his wife and told her that he was coming home tonight after an hour. At night, there came a stranger who said, 'I am not your son, Derbforcaill ingen Rvaid's! 'You have taken my servant for a daughter,' he said. Cu Chulainn threw the stone at him with his foot and said, 'I will not eat anything from you', 'except for the water. I will take my servant, Lugaid Reondercc.' And he took it","Cu Chulaind lifted the stone of Lochar Quaniarum and cast it into the sea, saying: 'This stone will be your shield tonight.' From this moment on, he was not hungry; for that was a day when he would eat a single fish. And as he walked by the shore, he saw the spirit of Derbforcaill ingen Rvaid & his companion standing there. ‘You are cursed in my house, Cu Chulaind!’ she cried. ‘You will be consumed by your own anger.’ So Cu Chulaind lifted the stone, placing it upon a log laid flat on the ground. “I shall not eat until you, O Lugaid Reonderscc,” he said, “for that is what I have come for. This is my task.”"

"When Cúchulainn's eight companions were slain by the men of Scannmenn, Ollamh Boind m-Breg and Comallustar, with the help of the goddess, they took refuge in a cave and escaped safely into the land of Emuin. At that time, Emperor Cræbruaidh Concopuir was at peace with the Ulaid and their allies, and he gave them a great reward for their loyalty. He sent two men to Ulltaib as hostages, namely Bricne Nemtengai mac Carbad. And this is what Cúchulainn said: 'Tell your lord', he said, 'that I will attend the feast of Concopar tonight, and that the king's daughter will be given to me for my wife, because it is a great honor for the Ulaid.'

They killed Coin Cvlaind & his daughter, who was beautiful, and their blood fell on the earth, like a bitter sorrow","They are burning the images of the idols in Ulster, and it is said that: Emer has been married to Concobar of the red branch, and Fercus and Cathbad have taken her as their wife: she was given to Con Culaind and Vlad was sent before him. This year they were slain. The sons of Conchubor are Emirie, son of the spear-slayer. They are crying out in the enclosure","They killed my enemies in the land of Ulster, and this I swear by: Emer was slain by Concobar at the feast of the ancient ones & Fercus & Cathfad a n-oinlepaid for her cruel deeds; she was taken captive by Con Culaind & Vlad was sent to the underworld on account of his treachery. This year has been most unlucky, and I swear this too: Icaid Conchubor tinnscrai Emirie íarnamaruch. They killed Coin Cvlaind & his daughter with a poisoned spear & their blood fell to the earth as if it had been poured out of a vessel","There is no peace between Ireland and Ulster in this winter, for I am aware that Emer was betrothed to Concobar's son Conall, the famous warrior, and that Ferchus and Cathfaid, his sister, were taken prisoner by Culainn, and Vlad the destroyer of men killed him. And since then there has been no peace among them"

The three poets of the world are not among the three men of Ireland,"The three poets of the Tuatha Dé Danann, Falias, Gorias, and Finias, were the only ones who possessed knowledge and wisdom","The three poets are not the three of the people; fair is the man of Falias; wise is the man of Gorias; clever is the man of Findias; strong is the man of Murias. It was these three poets, the sons of the filid, who learned the lore and wisdom of the Tuatha Dé Danann","The kings are not in their thrones yet, the sons of Manannan have sailed away; Morpheus is with Falias; Esras is at Goriah; Uiscias is with Findias; Semias is with Murias. It was these three courts of filid ocar of the Tuatha Dé Danann who had knowledge & wisdom"
"The Lord of the Tuatha Dé Danann in the great battle of Moytura fought against the Fomorians of Ériu, and his chariot was led by Cúchulainn before the pass of Corcu Bolg (i.e. Conmaicne Mara and the sons of Eathas), with a hundred men for each side. And on that day & in the sky there were seen the signs of the omen of the horse & the air, which they had foreseen. This is what we have heard from our fathers","The Lord of the Tuatha Dé Danann in great battles against the giants of Ériu gave his permission to those who were before the fortress of Feral Bolc (.i. the kingdom of the Connacht men),   with a portion of their army for the protection of their cattle","The Lord of the Tuatha Dé Danann shall descend into the depths of the ocean, and there will be great slaughter among the Fomorians of Éirinn (i.e. the Connacht region), with many of their warriors being slain by the hand of Lugh, as he descended from heaven to earth, taking the spear of light and the whip of the storm with him",The lord of the foreigners will give to Feraib Bolc and his people half of their land
"It was the winter of the great famine and the reign of King Máoth Scéni, namely Éri ingen Delbaíth; for it is said that the sea was full of waves like a great storm. And after that, there came this: he did not know: because the darkness was in him, and the light was not in his face","It was the winter of the great famine and the reign of King Máoth Scéni, namely Éri ingen Delbaíth; for it is said that the sea was full of waves like a great storm. And after that, there came this: he did not know: because the sun had set in his face","Our lord of the sea and our king's son, Máoth Scéni .i.

"They are in the house of the lord, and I am in the house of my father's brother. 'Where is this?' he said to them. 'We have come from the land of the Tuatha Dé Danann.' 'I have taken a vow of celibacy,' said the woman. 'The road goes through the forest, and I will meet you at the stone of the great king Túath(a) in the land of the goddess Dana. And I will give you my hand as a pledge, just like that,'","They killed her in the night, and they took her body to the well at the edge of the hill. 'Where is she?' he asked them. 'She has been taken by the robbers,' said the woman. 'I have cut off my foot so that I may not follow you into slavery. May the Lord protect me from your evil hands","The woman is dearer than the man, whose wife is under the same roof as his wife's father. 'Who is this?' he says to them. 'They are my brother-in-law,' says the woman. 'The marriage of our kin has been broken by a certain kindredman. The lord of Tuath(a) has taken me from my foster-mother and my foster-father, as you know,'","They made it high. The house of their neighbour, the man of the hill was over the sea as far away from me as the sea and I from you, said he. 'Where is this place?' asked he of them. 'It lies in the fruitless land,' said the woman. 'The road divides between us in the common land. We are the Túatha Dé Danann at the edge of my kingdom & at the entrance to our own like yourselves"
"He is the son of Anidín, a descendant of Elothae mac Delpaíth, king of Fomore. Berach mac diar was his father, and he had no other name but Eocha Bres (and from Eocha Cruthach), for every creature in Ireland —man and woman and cow and ox and horse and each-is rising mac-sin to be born, until there is not a single one of them 'as' Bres in it","He is the son of Andísin and the son of Elthae mac Delpaith king of Fomor. Berach mac diar comruc, and he has no other name but Eocha Bres (from Eocha Cruthach), for every creature in Ireland — earth and hill and cow and coin and woman and man and beast—is rising up against him — until there is none left 'as Bres' in that place","The son of the king of Fomor is dead and is in the land of the gods. Berach, son of Diarmuid, was his name, and though he had no other name but Eochaid Bres (and from Eoch Cruthach), each of the giants who attacked Ireland —the earth and the hill and the fortress and the coin and the castle and the tower and the fort—will rise again in the same manner as that which is risen over Bres there","Our Lord be merciful to him, and that Ditánic the son of Elthae mac Delpaith, king of Fomor, should find a refuge in his name. But Berach mac diar has no name, save Eocha Bres (that is of the race of Oecha Cruthach), who was born on each form of the land —of rock and fortress and mound and ringfort and fortlet and castle and hill—and it is rising to him that son-slayer, who slew Bres there"
"The Lord is not slow in making his promise, keeping it for you from the beginning of the world; but I will be faithful still, and keep my promise forever, to bring you into the land which is yours, an inheritance as your fathers before you have kept it all these years. And now the land lies waste because of this sin, & the people are scattered abroad in the land. I am the Lord who dwells among them, and I will not forget the covenant that I made with their fathers, when they dwelt in this city, which is called Dun Brese. And behold, it was I, the God of hosts, who sent you out from there","It is the custom of the Irish that the lord of the land shall be the son of the king; and it is decreed by law. That the mother of the land shall not be driven from her territory, nor shall she be forced to leave her own country. It is decreed that the mother of the land shall be dearer than all other lands. And it is decreed that the fortress of the land shall be Dun Brese; and this was the stronghold of Dagda's people","Our Lord Jesus Christ is the King of Ireland, and his power extends to the whole world; & he rules over all the kings of Ireland; & he governs all the people of Ireland (i.e. their mothers) in this world, & in the next. His mother is the land that is equal to him, & the strong fortress of the land is Dun Brese. And it was the Dagda's dog who destroyed that land, which is said","Certainly the son of Boí is lord of Túath Déu; and he shall have authority over all Erin; and he shall drive all strangers out of Erin (i.e. the mother) to his place in the high fortress of Ireland; and he shall possess the fortresses of his ancestors' lands, that their valorous deeds may be told for ever. And it is said that this daughter was a tower to him, and the strong dun of Uaran Ireland, i.e. Dun Brese. And he was the Dagda's dog, son of one"
"When the Danu descended to the Dagda, she took his spear, and with it, she broke open the door of her house, Cridenbél by name, and she was about to kill him as a bull in the brindlemark. But when Crichnebel saw that the Dagda's oxen were not killed, & that he was still alive, 'A Dagda, dot inchaib na trí mírionn bes dech dot chuid tapraither dom-sae!' (i.e., 'The Dagda, who has three miracles to show for his own strength!') Every night, the Dagda would be there. Many a miracle of the Dagda's were that he was not killed. May the blessings of the Dagdhae be upon you","When Danu's son Dagda was at work, and his spear was in the hut, Cridenbél was his name, and he was a great warrior as to the brindlemark. But when Crichinphél was with him, and but one of the Dagda's spears was left, 'A Dagda, that inchaib na trí mírionn bes dech dot chuid tapraither dom-sae!' (i.e., 'I am a spear of three years' work')! He would be at every night. Many an hour were spent on the Dagda's spear. Three years passed with but one of the Dagda's spears. May the blossoms of the Dagdhae be upon you","There was a great host of the Dagda in his house, and many were seated beside him, Cridenbél by name, who was slain for his treachery as he sat on his bed. But there was one more to Crichinphél than to the Dagda. And it is said that when the Dagda went into battle, 'A great host of the Dagda, not three times a hundred men are equal to my spear!' He was killed every night by some one of the enemies. Much woe befell them who killed him; I mean, his spear was very long. But three times as many were the hosts of the Dagdha than three times a hundred men","Daniel the prophet had a vision in his home, Cridenbél by name, and heard the voice of God in it, saying: 'Daniel, four weeks were four days shorter than three months from my own time!' It was given to Daniel every night. Many people were anxious about this matter; I will tell you what happened to them - a great fear came over them - they thought that it would be one hundred eighty-four days before the end of their appointed period, and when the appointed periods of these three men had passed, they knew that Daniel was in God's hands"
"It was good, Dagdai, I said to Mac n-Óc, and he replied: 'Well done,' I said. 'Did you do it well?' he asked. 'I did,' I said. 'You will be rewarded,' he said. 'We have been waiting for three years in the dark, and we are not yet out of it.'","It is good, Dagdai, that you have come to the house of Mac n-Óc with a hundred men","It's good, Dagdai,' said Mac Óc, 'Amen,' replied the Dagda. 'How long will you live?' asked the Dagda. 'I shall live until my hand fails me,' he replied. 'You'll be sorry when you've lost all your strength in three million years, or so I've been told,'","Come, Dagdai, the cow is in the meadow with MacÓc's son, and I am well, thank you very much. It is a beautiful day, isn't it? Come take your cloak"
"They say that the fairies of Clonbolcán went to a great feast in Cluain Cilli, where they danced with Tir na n-Óg and Tir Bóghaine. They came from the land of the sidhe, where there was life and water on that night. The sidhe took their horses. It is said that this fairy was more beautiful than any other in that cellar, so the people of Brughaigh mac Deaghaidh would often visit her and she told them: 'Be careful,' he said, 'for I am a great danger to those who do not know me'; and the song went like this from above:","They say that the fairies are in the well of Bolcáin, and they will be waiting for you there to meet Clúain Cilli and Thíre Chonaill & Thíre Bóghaine. They came out of the well of the poor people of Brughaigh mic Deaghaidh, and a great fear was in their hearts that night. The fairies took their cattle. It is said that it is an omen for the family of Brughaigh mic Deaghaidh & there was a great mourning there that night when they went to Suibhne so much that the fairies would have been able to see them; and he said: ‘Woe be upon you,’ he said, ‘that you are in Muigh Rath so poor and so difficult to find’; and the song is sung thus above:","They were carrying a great burden of the treasures of Clonbolcán to Restalgo, in order that they might bring them to the well of St. Cilli and the well of St. Bolcáin; for after passing over the marshes where they had crossed with their cattle on that night, they found it full of bogs & water there. They took up their baggage again the next morning. As was said in that place: 'Woe is me,' he said, 'that I have been robbed of my noble steed in that difficult night; and that I was pursued by Suibhne to a great degree, so that I am not able to describe it; and thus the poem goes:","My wife left our Bolcáin Well at Clúain Cilli, near the well of Tíre Chonaill & Tíre Bóghaine. We had waited for her from night till night; but it was a very stormy night and she was drowned in the river there. They took my husband's body away, and they said to him: 'A woe upon you,' he answered, 'for I fell into the quicksands of Muigh Rath that day and nearly lost myself.' And when he recited the verse below:"
"My wife Suibne is waiting for me before the well at Snamh two Én of Sionainn, near the boundary of Cluain Boirenn that day; she has taken the milk from the cow there. As I was leaving the house, the priest lit the fire in the night and men were gathered there with women and children around it. 'I have not eaten,' said Suibne, 'the food of my mother's people.' 'The breast of the cow is good,' he said, 'as much so that it would be a remedy for my brother-in-law in the battle of Maigh Rath.' The man took up his spear and went away: 'I am waiting for her,' he said, 'voice of the cows on the back of Banna to each of the people in the land, I will sing tonight,' and thus he sang","They say that Suibhne was killed before the battle of Snamh Dha Én for Sionainn, near Cluain Boirenn; and they say that he was slain by his own hand in a fit of rage. They say that the woman who bore him was not his wife, 'for she had borne another man,' said Suibhne, 'the son of Choimdedh, whom my mother had married.' 'I am not ashamed of her,' said he, 'for she is a noblewoman, and I will avenge her death in the battle of Maigh Rath,' said he. They say that his cloak was wrapped around him as he died: 'It was the cloak of the women of the Banna, with every leathern thong on it, and the leather strap on my arm,' he said, 'and I will sing this song","They were burying Suibhne before the hill of Snamh two Én for Sionainn, on the boundary of Cluain Boirenn this side; they dug a well there and found a cow dead in it. As he was burying his father's child, said Suibhne, 'for my women's sake', 'the cow died of the sickness', said he, 'as I know that will bring ruin to my brother-in-law in the battle of Maigh Rath.' He took up his spear and began to speak: 'It was a good omen for me,' said he, 'the voice of the cows on the back of the Ban of each tribe, every one of them singing with joy this evening', so they sang the song:","The woman was found dead before her husband was brought into the church in Clonburren, a comar in County Clare; she had been strangled with her hair that morning. 'I am not for sale,' said the wife, 'to my husband's daughter.' 'The price of your head is high,' said he, 'and to prove this I will make a vow: every woman at the bank of Banna has a handsome youth watching over them, so I'll take one from tonight,' sang he"
