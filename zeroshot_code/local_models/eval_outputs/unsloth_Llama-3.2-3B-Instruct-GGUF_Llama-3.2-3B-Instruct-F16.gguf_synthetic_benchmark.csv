Their leader was Conall, Coinculaind, and Lóegaire. “You have killed me” said Conall to his companion “I will not eat your flesh until I reach the other side of the world.” And each of the Ulaid warriors who fought in this battle were driven out by the enemy from men of great courage, with slaughter and destruction all around them on earth; and it is said that no one among the nobles in the imbarbag was left alive. And so the nobility in the imbarbag or comrama did not remain but were driven out to the other side of the world","They say the greatest of the battles were fought at Ulster, against Nand and on Sliab Fúait; there are five kings who did great things: Connell and Coinculaind and Lóegaire. “You have wounded me” said Connell to Mei Greggare about his spear which broke on the enemy in the battle of the comras"

"They say that Roboi gave this to me, namely seven years and no more, but the air is in my womb now, namely I have conceived Christ for the sake of the Jews. It's a great side, a mighty cross and a thorn in my side until I die, namely I am the son of God, born of a virgin. 'Is it true?' Conall asked to the Druid. “How much evil is there in this woman since she was taken from her husband?” “She is a man from her womb,” the Druid replied. “It's a great sin” said Conall. “This is the one who gave me the poison and the gall, namely I am in eight cold winters without copulation for twenty years.”","The Lord has done great things for me, and I am not worthy to mention them, but I will try. I have seen the signs of Christ in my church, that is, that he was born of a virgin. There are many great miracles performed by him since his death, and one miracle in particular, which took place at the time of my baptism, namely, that he rose from the dead on the third day, and that he gave life to all men, so that they might live forever. “Is this true?” asked Conall to the prophet. “How great a wonder is this child?” “He is a man,” said the prophet. “This miracle is great,” said Conall. “This man has done great things,” said the prophet “in the land of Egypt, and in the desert for forty years.”","The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing; he makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he refreshes my soul, he guides me on the right paths for his name's sake.

You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. “Is it true?” Conall asked the prophet. “Does he have a great mother, or is she from Lebanon?” “He has a great mother,” replied the prophet. “It is a great thing,” said Conall. “This man is my lord,” said the prophet “in the land of the blind, and in the wilderness you are the light; and you will bring me to the house of God.”","The Lord took Mary, a maiden, from this world; and eight days passed since his death, until the air was still in her womb; that is, nine months had elapsed, until she felt Christ's soul pass into the flesh.

"God will be merciful to the faithful in the life of my son and protect us from the enemies of Christ for the sake of His crucifixion; it is said that a red-haired man was seen speaking incantations against Meic Gra, at his head and on his neck, Concubur, a fierce warrior. The prophet [he] spoke to the Gaels, saying he Concubur would destroy the people of Ireland, fearing that he would drink from the well in his hand. And since then Conall's soul has risen up to Christ for our sake: may Christ be with him always, as is the case with the prophets who have spoken to us","God will be merciful to the faithful in this life and the next because of Christ's mercy towards me; it is said that there was a great sorrow in the heart of Conal: he wept for the Judaeans who were crucified before Christ, and in his sorrow, he would often speak of Christ with the people and would lament the death of Concubur, a noble warrior. He had heard from the Gaels that Concubur would be killed by the enemy, but God will not let him die in vain; and as it is said, Conal's soul was lifted up to heaven before Christ: he saw the brook which he had often spoken of, and Christ spoke to him with his spirit","The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want; he makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he revives my soul.

My eyes are grey with grief over my wife and my children, the sons of Athechda, who will perish in (that is, in) Óengus' house. I have been forced to take refuge there and to hide from him and his men. Dubchrón has gone to Dubglais, that is, to be taken captive. “Tairling, a Dubchróin,” he says. “No,” says Dubchrón. “Is it Cate Óengus?” “There are the children; sit, sit, do not let them see how sad we are. Tairling and I will stay in this house.” “I will not leave my children except if they are with me. The men have been killed,” says he. They depart. “Fír, a Óengus,” he says. And he said: “Go to the children who are white as snow in the bed of Óengus.”","They will fight, because of Óengus' treachery against the people of Athechda and because he has killed men on his lord's side. (Not Dubchrón's son, that was in the same place.) I have seen a grey-haired man with one eye and one arm and the sons of Athechda are dying in it (i.e. in Óengus' house) until three times the number of those who were killed will be avenged. The lord has been angry and is going to take revenge on him and his men. Dubchrón is going to Dubglais, i.e. he is being taken captive. “Tairling, a Dubchróin,” said he. “No,” said Dubchrón. “Is it Óengus?” “There are the corpses; sit, sit, do not think of it. Tairling and that is his house.” “I will not eat my fill of the corpse unless I see him dead. The man has been killed,” he said. He went away. “Fir, a Óengus,” he said. And he said: “Go to the other side of the corpse where it is white and pure for Óengus.”","He fought, and the sons of Óengus were killed with him in that Aithechdaid, and they were slain on the side of men, to avenge them. (Not the son of Dubchrón, his gill, at the same time.) I will take my greyhound, and my spear, and the children of Athechda, who are in (i.e., in the house) of Óengus, until (i.e., when) three times have been slain. Benait (it was) before him, and he has taken it from them and brought it to his hand, and it is a good omen and a protection for him. Dubchrón was taken by Dubglais. i.e. for the taking of him. “Tairling, my Dubchróin,” said he. “Notho,” said Dubchrón. “Cate Óengus?” “There are the clothes; sit, sit, and do not be afraid. Tairling and that is our house.” “I will not take your clothes except when I see them coming. The spear of the enemy was taken away,” he said. Gattair (he) departed. “Fir, my Óengus,” he said. And he said: “Go to the dogs of Óengus; in their land there is a great battle for him.”","Certainly, I will kill that Uisneag of the red hand at your side and for men's sake to avenge you"
