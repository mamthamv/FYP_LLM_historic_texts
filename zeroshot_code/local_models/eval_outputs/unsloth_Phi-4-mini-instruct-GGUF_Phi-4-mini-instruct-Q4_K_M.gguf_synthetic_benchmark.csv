"Many battles were fought by Ultonia's warriors at Sliabh Fuait, including Conall Cernach and Connlaind of the Hundred Battles; they sought glory without shame or reproach for their deeds on land as well as sea against countless foes","Many battles were fought for Ultonia, including those at Sliab Fuait and elsewhere; Conall Mac Nessa led them bravely alongside Connlaind of Coire Chonnail and Coincal O'Connor with Lóegaire Ó Neachtain. 'Tucaid dam-sa' was said by Conall: 'I will not let go until I have conquered Ultonia.' And many battles were fought for Ireland, including those at Sliab Fuait; the Irish nobility did their best to fight them off bravely","In Ulster, the great battle was fought at Slieve Fáil by Diodorus and his men; they were joined with Conn of the Hundred Battles along with Conall Cearnach, Coincluind, Lóegaire Mac Néill: 'He who lives long will see,' said Conall. The army advanced under Ulster's banner without shame through Ireland to fight against Christians in a great battle as planned; and they went forth boldly into the enemy ranks both by land and sea","Ultonian warfare and Irish feuds, a perpetual state of strife from Ulster to Connacht; Conall Mac Nessa was known for his wisdom as well as Cormac Loingsech's eloquence with the sword alongside Diarmait O'Conor (the King), who sought peace even amidst turmoil. And there were those whose arrogance and contempt could not be restrained, nor their hostility contained by justice or restraint"
May God grant you the same as he has granted me,May God save you and me,May God protect you as he protected his friend,May the spirit of Connla come to me in your time
"Many people are gathered for the feast before a great king's arrival. A messenger from Aranbarrach will bring news to you about Mac Matach and his men who have crossed into Ultonia. There is also much talk of Rob Roy in Heron, as well as tales concerning Fúait and Lethachind with regard to Ultaib","Many people are gathered for the feast before a great king's arrival, as it is said that he will come with his army to Ulaid. A large number of men from Cet and Máth mac Matach have assembled in Hibernia; they too came together after hearing about Ultaib","Many people are ready for the battle ahead, as told by Abrahám of Israel; Daniel was a prophet who did not conform to their ways like Elisha in Damascus and Hírnán in Cet. He also spoke against idolatry with great fervor alongside them","The dawn came quietly before the black horse crossed paths with me. I asked where he went, but it was not clear for long or short: such a strange encounter in Herne's Cét"

And I shall always have a great feast with fire at nightfall when the sun sets, along with cold water","God forbid that anyone should slay women instantly, for the sons of Cet have slain Mesgegra's daughter in his house with poison from Connla who had been given three horses; they are a fierce race and swift as lightning","Gods will be done for Cet, as it shall come to pass at Mesgegra's table with Chet; there was no one left among the Ulaid except Conall who went after him and took his torch-lighting seat in front of them all","The lady refused to marry them until she saw the youth of Menmoth, who was handsome with long hair braided over his head like Conal's daughter; he lived by faith in Dál Araich and Conall Mac Bhuidhb Ruairc; Áthdaraig Dá Báidhe is as Connal for beauty.

'I am his son!' said Conall. 'Dobér is king over Ultaib for a hundred generations.' 'Not so,' replied Cend Berraide, and he went to gather wisdom at Arddachad Emain Macha. Many years ago Crích Ross left behind in the west; I was Dobertar Ulaid's son: that means there will be kings of this place forever","Many years ago, Crích Ross went to Sciaig Aird at Connad and stayed there with Dobertar Ulaid until he died beside Ath Daire Dá Báeth.

"Many years ago, there was an oak tree and a fir tree standing beside the silver stream; Conchobuir's red horse stood by his white mare as well as Connla's black stallion in front of them [Connla also had a brown colt]. And many horses were gathered together for battle or to escape danger","Many years ago, there was an oak tree and a fir tree that grew beside Conchobuir's house with its red door; also the silver-haired woman of Connall came to him from afar in his hall [and she brought wine for everyone] as well as many women who were beautiful","The red-haired warrior struck the foe and fled, as Conchobuir with his golden hair escaped; while another soldier chased after Connall's servant in a furious rage until he reached him or met an untimely death","He rose early in the morning, and he went out to see Conchobuir wearing red garments as well as black clothes over his own white clothes; also Connacht came with twelve men ready for battle against all those they encountered [and many of them were killed], who fell before him"

Conan's eyes were filled with anger and hatred as he spoke to Jesus Christ from the cross saying that He had taken away His life for Him,"Conan's eyes were filled with tears and sorrow as he spoke to Jesus Christ in the Galilee saying that his brother had died without leaving any heir at all; so Conan went up into a mountain weeping, for when they met him on their way Conor told them about what happened: 'Jesus saw this man coming toward Him crying out because of His father. He said 'Your son was dead in sin and your daughter has just been born.' Finid","Conan said to Jesus Christ standing before Him with sorrow in his heart and tears streaming down His cheeks as He spoke of the multitude that would come after him; thus Conan stood beside Jesus crying out aloud: 'Lord, You are my God who took me from prison through Your mercy.' Finid","It is just that Avarlet Conall would say to the king of Judea after Christ had appeared for him in his dreams and told Him not what He should do: 'You are worthy because it was said by an angel, 'Fear God'.' It may be so; but I have seen a dream when my father went with me. And he revealed many things that happened to us at the time"
"Many a man has been blinded by the light of Jesus Christ, and he was taken away from me without mercy for my sake this year; I have seen many things that are hidden which will be revealed to you in due time when your Lordship comes into power after His death","Many a nobleman was unwilling to give his allegiance even when the Lord of Ireland demanded it, nor would he offer any aid or protection for Christendom against those who sought its ruin","In the mind of God, none can escape His judgment; even those who attempt to hide from Him will be found by God's omniscience","Many a time, when Christ Jesus was about to suffer death on the cross of Jerusalem's captivity and at its release from prison; many who were captives with him cried out: 'I am beside you always.' He also prayed for his disciples in order that they might be strengthened by their faith like Peter. But this power did not come only through them, but Christ suffered for us according to the will of God"

He was a great king: he did not kill anyone for the sake of Ossairge nor any other man; but Óengus would never strike him with his spear or throw it at him from afar. When they met together in battle against each other's armies, Mac Connaid said to them all that 'Mac Máil is a great king and he has many sons: I will not kill anyone for the sake of Mac Máil nor any other man.' And Óengus replied with his spear saying 'I do not wish harm upon Mac Máil or on him who fights against us. He is our lord, let no one strike me unless it be in battle","The battle of Mac Connaid and Marcán against Óengus was fierce, as they fought valiantly for Ireland's sake. Óengus sought the aid of Dimma Chróin; he sent messengers to Óengus in England with a promise that if Óengus came back victorious from his war abroad, then great rewards would be given him and all those who assisted him","The oak was broken by Mac Connaid, and Marcán, and Óengus. And Óengus struck down the demon at Dimma's church: for he saw not that God had sent his three sons; nor did Óengus see them with their weapons ready to battle against it [the dragon]. So Máel said in mockery of Mac Connaid because he lacked strength and Óengus couldn't face him when they met. And a young man approached: 'Is Cumhal has given you the power over Máel, so that none will be able after you; neither did Óengus stand up to defeat [the dragon].' But one who spoke boldly said in mockery of Mac Connaid because he lacked strength and Óengus couldn't face him when they met. 'Is Cumhal has given you the power over Máel, so that none will be able after you; neither did Óengus stand up to defeat [the dragon]."

Do not forget Óengus who came with a multitude; he fought for his people and brought peace as if it were God's will: 'May this be my reward,' said I, 'that all that you have done in your lifetime may please Him.' Behold the Lord is just! He loves those whom they love themselves. But let none go before him until death parts them; he shall judge every man according to his works and by what one has eaten or drunk—only as much as a man's strength allows, for this too will be judged on one's own day","May God grant you success. Oengus the son of Áed found favor and was victorious over those who opposed him until they submitted their faith at night: 'May your counsel prosper,' he said, 'may it remain as a steadfast belief in this time for me to pass through them safely; may my life be preserved by God's hand.'"
"May fortune favor you, O King of Tara! Fair is the day for battle? 'Are we ready to fight?' said Oengus: 'I am prepared with my men and weapons.' And Ind answered him; he rode his horse through a narrow pass where many warriors gathered together in one place. 'Let us go,' they all agreed, as King Óengus spoke of the day when Tara would be victorious over its enemies","Be fair, Oengus said; let us not be divided by enmity","Stay firm, Oengus; your immunity stands strong against the plague",Today is fair and beautiful

Fear not, nor dare to invade this good territory because you are few while I am many - just as Dubhghort commands for himself; 'I will speak,' says he. But Dungal is silent: why does that matter? Do you think it matters whether a small boy speaks when there’s no wind or air in him, and the rest of them won't move without his consent?' Ah well then Oengus - but what good would it do to stand up for this territory if it's not yours; since Aithechdai has placed here before us (the enemy), how will you argue?
