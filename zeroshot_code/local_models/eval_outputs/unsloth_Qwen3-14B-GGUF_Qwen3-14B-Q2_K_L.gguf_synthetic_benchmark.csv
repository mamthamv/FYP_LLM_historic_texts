"A great battle was for Ulster against the men of Slieve Foy. The slaughter and the rout were great, namely, the rout of Conall and Coincullan and Lóegaire. 'I will not go with you,' said Conall, 'unless I have a share in the plundering of the land and the spoils.' It was a great thing for Ulster that in that battle each man who had been wounded received compensation from the plundered lands, and the men of the army were given a share of the spoil according to their worth, and the women were given a share of the goods and the cattle. And also in the slaughter or rout which was done against them, they were given a share of the spoils","A great battle was for Ulster against the men of Slieve Foy.

It was a great thing for Ulster in that battle each man who had been wounded on the galloping of the horse, or the foot of the spear, or the cutting of the sword, or the striking of the shield.

"And thus said Conall: 'I have made known to men in my life and in the battle of my soul against the idolatry of the Jews, the faith of Christ which I have believed in.' Thus then was he drawn and cast into a dark prison by the cunning of Meshael, from his head and the deceitful Concubor. And thus it was that the Gaels, with this Concubor, would not be able to obtain the kingdom of heaven, nor would they be able to inherit the land of Ireland, for their blood was shed from their heads. And thus it was that Conall's soul was united with Christ in the truth of the cross, and so that Christ would unite with Conall's soul against the darkness. Finid","And thus said Conall: 'I have made known to men in my life that I would not be in the company of those who are in the company of the sons of Judah, for the love of Christ, unless they were to be with me in the company.' Thus was it afterwards, and a great sorrow came upon them from the deceitful counsel of Mesgegra at his head and the deceitfulness of Concubur. And thus the Gaels, and thus Concubur, would not have been able to bring about the destruction of their own country, unless they had been in the company of Christ with regard to the truth of the faith, for Christ was with Conall against them in the company. Finid","And thus said Conall: 'I have given my strength in the battle of my soul against the enemies of the faith of Christ, for my own sin and the forgiveness thereof.' Thus then was drawn forth and set in place a certain dark cloud over the head of Meshael, and the likeness of Concubur as a leader. Conall [was] desirous to tell the Gaels that Concubur was a noble and worthy man who would be a king of the land of Ireland, for he had been wounded in his head. And thus was the soul of Conall drawn into the company of Christ against the darkness of the night and the brightness of the day, so that Christ went with the soul of Conall to the kingdom of heaven. Finid","And thus said Conall: 'I will go forth with the strength of my soul into battle against the sons of Judah who have been bound by the bond of Christ's covenant.' Thus then was the assembly gathered and a great council held before Mesgnaer, from his head and from Concubur the leader. And it was that the men of Goidel would not allow Concubur to be slain in their land, for the blood which he had shed from his head. And so it was that Conall's soul was brought into a bond with Christ, against the flame of the fire and the breath of the wind, as Christ would bring Conall's soul into union with the blessed. Finid"
