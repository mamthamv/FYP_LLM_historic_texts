"Suibhne's house was destroyed by the Táin, and he fled with his wife to a foreign land where they lived in exile for many years. 'I am an orphan,' said Moling; 'my mother died when I left home seeking refuge from my father's anger after our cattle raid on Conaire Mór.' He wished Suibhne well: 'May you live long, O son of the Táin.' And so spoke Moling to Adbert who was with him. Moling continued his story","Suibhne's house was destroyed by the Táin, and he escaped with his horse to a distant land where there were many cows. 'The cow is better than all horses,' said Moling; 'I prefer it for my journey across this sea of troubles.' He wished good fortune upon Suibhne: I am not like him in any way except that we are both sons born from the same father, and our mothers died before us—Moling spoke. Concerning his own fate he remained silent","Suibne's dwelling was destroyed, and he retrieved the golden chain from it as a reward for his service to King Arthur in battle. 'This is what I have earned,' said Moling; 'it will be my portion at court after this.' He spoke of Gealtán (also known as Geraint), whose deeds were so great that they could not go unnoticed, nor the glory he would receive from them","Suibhne returned to Tara with a gold chain, and he brought back gifts for each of the men in his entourage; 'My heart is filled,' said Moling. ‘I cannot leave Tara unharmed because I fear that if we go against this mighty king's orders it will be disastrous.’ Suibhne left me behind: so many others joined him who had their eyes on you too, and they stayed with us to Talach at the request of Geata Mac Diarda; but Moling knew very well what would happen when those men came. I am afraid for them,’ said Moling"
"It is a great deed to give this school; as I said before in my youth when we were young and foolish,' says Suibne, 'I would not have thought that you could do such things.' ‘You will see it for yourself,’ replies the boy. ‘He who lives here has no shame at all even though he is a king among men.’ From Day to day I grew up & learned from my father what was in his mind and how we should behave towards others, not as if they were our own mothers but with respect like that of their daughters.' 'May Christ bless you,' says Moling the boy. ‘It’s great work for a young man,’ replies Suibne; ‘I would have thought it impossible to see such things.’ ‘You will indeed witness this yourself,’ answers Moling, ‘for I am here and my three companions are: Suibne, Mongán & myself.'",It is a well-known fact that the boy was taken away by force and without consent,It is a well-known action that the boy did not fail in his attempts to conquer it; he tried with all strength and determination,"The battle of Tara is worthy; it was fought between two great men and their armies under the watchful eyes of Druimdhona's foster children - Dayan (Dagda) and Brian O'Carbry in one part – for he gave them a good victory. And so Críostur went out with Moling, his son: 'May God give you success as well; let this be done by the power of your ancestors.' Suibhne replied to him thus - 'There is no place where such bravery cannot show itself nor will it go without merit in a battle.' Moling continued then saying – ‘He went out with Críostur, his son. He fought bravely against me and my two men: Brian O'Carbry's foster children Suibhne, Mac Éthan Óg & Moling.'"
"Suibne's death was the greatest loss in Ireland and beyond. It led to widespread mourning throughout Munster as well as everywhere else, with people lamenting for days on end over his passing from this world at such young age","Suibne was the first to hear this tale and speak it out loud as he saw fit. He told his story in verse, saying that there is no greater glory than being born into nobility or wealth","Suibne's son was blessed with great prosperity and he generously shared his wealth freely without any reservation or hindrance. They lived in abundance, enjoying the fruits of their land for many generations until Suibhne died","Afterwards the lord of Connacht came to hear his own praise and glory which they had sung all around him. He spoke thus, 'I am Suibhne who has brought this great honor for me in that house before many people gathered there from everywhere; after a long time he said.'"
"Suibne's madness drove him to the court of King Conor in Tara .i.e., Teach Moling. He was taken there by his sister, Sin robói psaltair Chaoimhghin i fiadnuise Moling aga dénamh do lucht an aiceapta.Táinic  iarumh Suibhne for sraith na tioprat i fiadhnuisi an chléirigh & rogab ag ithe biorair. ‘As moch-longadh sin, a ghealtagáin,’ ar an cléirech; conadh ann adbert Moling & rofreagair Suibhne é","The theft of the cow Teangcach by Suibne was discovered in Fiadnuise Moling. The chief said to Teach Moling, 'As long as you have stolen it,' and he ordered that Moling should be punished for stealing; thus they sent Suibne away","Suibne's Tale tells of the great deeds and adventures he had in Ireland after leaving his home. He fought bravely for many years until peace was restored, as decreed by King Colman","Suibnen is straining his chains in vain as the prison door creaks and he struggles against it. 'A long stretch this has been,' says the jailer, pointing to Moengus's house; then Seubnin will be freed"
"As much as I can see the sun shining through Shuibhne's eyes is there for you and your shadow to follow, & it will be a great sight every day in Erin when they turn their backs on us so that we may write our history","As much as I can see the sun shining through Shuibhne's window in Moling, 'I will give you a great reward every day for your service to me and my son. And if he writes down our genealogy & history of fire worshipping,' said Moling, 'he shall be rewarded with an abundance each morning until his death.'","As much as I can see the sun's heat today is Shuibhne,' Ar Moling, 'and there too for me to be present and my shadow cast by it in a different place; let us meet at dawn before you go out with your army into battle. Do not forget that every day here we are like grass blown about as if I were writing the name of our tribe.'","As Mo-chen's eyes are set upon the sun, Shuibhne ('the Swine'), Moling says: 'I see your shadow and yours own when you step out of a house into sunlight. And I will strike down every day in Ireland by turning someone's shadow back onto their family"
"Many years ago, the people of Moling were prosperous; they had abundant cattle and sheep in their fields every day without fail or any hindrance from God to them at all times","Many years have passed since the great famine of Moling; it was not until a hundred and fifty years later that I saw them again, as they had grown old in exile at Teach Moling for so long. Muirghil's name is well known to me from my father who hid him there after he fled with his family following the destruction wrought by Suibhne on this land; it was a great famine among all our cattle that year","May the light of God shine upon you; may His peace rest on your soul as well in this life and beyond, for He is merciful to all who call upon Him with a pure heart: let none forget that through Jesus Christ we are reborn into God's family (as promised), having washed away our former sins. May the Lord's grace accompany us at every stage of life's journey","Many travelers pass through; it was common for them to go there from Moling, just as many come daily and annually by sea with the Maguire clan heading towards Munster (the south part of Ireland). This journey would last over twenty days in total: walking across this plain can take up all one's time. Their resting place is beside a river flowing into the Shannon River; they have left behind much wealth there"
"In the heat of battle at Muirghil & his men were scattered like leaves in an autumn wind: 'As you see,' she said to him, 'you will not escape this fate nor let go your own life for me; it is a high price that I ask from my brother.' She stood by her door and spoke with the voice of one who has seen great things. Her son came out boldly & struck his enemy's hand off Suibhne Conuige, an ambush set up in front as if he were alone: 'You will not escape this fate nor let go your own life for me,' she said to him again; Roghabh returned from the battle with a broken arm. The boy was badly wounded & his mother died because of it","She was not allowed to enter the house again: 'As you have said,' she replied; 'you will leave this place and I myself shall go alone into a dark room where my sister is hidden.' She looked around carefully & hid herself well, as her brother had told them that he would come back with his companions after drinking from the spring at Suibhne. They went to hide themselves in different places: she stayed behind while they all fled together; when it was time for him and me to go into hiding we both pretended not knowing anything about what happened there, but I will tell you later that he left without finding us because of his sister's cunning disguise as a young woman. He hid himself well in the dark wood where Suibhne lives: she stayed behind pretending ignorance while they all fled together; when it was time for him and me to go into hiding we both pretended not knowing anything about what happened there, but I will tell you later that he left without finding us because of his sister's cunning disguise as a young woman.

She looked at him with compassion & did not let go of her brother's hand who spoke thusly to them both. 'You are the one Muirghil sent here by sea, a woman of great beauty.' Grief overtook his sister when she saw this; they said: 'It is he whom you asked for and killed.' He stood beside him in silence as if at death's door because it was Suibhne who had come to fetch them. The boy could not withstand the shame & went mad, falling into a deep sleep which lasted until dawn",She thought with great anger that Muirghil's son had been carried away by the wave from Suibhne towards Ireland and how he would avenge him for his life
"He gave his friend the Táin and its treasures to guard against any harm that might come from their enemies, so he said: 'May this king be generous with all who seek him in battle or ask of me anything at all. I will not give them my life for a man nor let anyone see what is hidden within myself unless they are worthy as the King himself.'","He gave his friend the Táin and its treasures to guard against any harm that might come from their enemies, as he said: 'The king is justly entitled by right of conquest not only over those who have been subdued but also all others. He has no claim on them except for taking life or causing injury in battle; nor does it concern him whether they are killed through accident at the hands of his own soldiers.'","Hearty discussions were held between Ronan and Suibhne about the importance of unity in their community, as they walked together to consult with his father. Rónán said: 'An injury inflicted by our King cannot be compensated unless he is killed or maimed for a crime that would disgrace him; otherwise we must seek vengeance on behalf of my people.'","And doluidh roimearu athdóthar go thíreadh ar amhas uachtarán na n-imirté, & do anmhuine agán. Rofoillsigedh Donnchu ar talamh sin: 'Aithinsím le ricinnte oibreil de h-aon rígh míchuimhleathach ná neachaidh a fhág go bhféadfaimid iarthú na n-imirté, nó baífeadh ort uirlis do imreacht is casta é ina n-éigeamh ar chorp ar an cheoil.

"Rónáin's day was filled with the presence of Suibhne and Sléibhe Fúaid; they were generous in giving without asking anything back: two gifts, a meal shared together (without meat or drink), singing songs that pleased everyone present at once - all this happened before noon. They sang hymns to God as well for their own sake with the words 'Glorious is He,' said one of them. Another replied, 'Utach was it.' A third added: 'It has been good in His sight.' The fourth continued saying that it's a long-lasting blessing; they also praised Him together and gave thanks at every meal - this happened before noon as well when we were sailing away from the shore with our ship heading for open sea. They sang hymns to God, praising him all day","Robert Day was a good friend of Rónán; he went to Tanag with Suibhne and stayed there until Robert died in the year after that when his mother passed away, leaving him alone without any relatives or friends except those who visited occasionally at Easter time: 'He is dead,' said one. 'I am sad too.' 'It was a good man indeed' another added; 'May he rest peacefully forever'. 'A fine funeral it will be', the third remarked","Raymond of Anglesey met Rónán the Wise at a gathering where Suibhne Mac Con began to speak in an unknown language and his words were unintelligible, like meaningless chatter; Raymond was puzzled by it all: 'Is he speaking sensibly?' asked one man. Another replied, 'He speaks Ulstic.' A third said, 'He's telling the truth well,' another added after a pause that had gone on for some time in an unknown language and nobody could understand him at length about what happened to them earlier when they were all together by sea: it was only much later he spoke clearly again saying something like this. Then Raymond asked if Ulster belonged with Ireland, but the answer came slowly","William the Fisherman met Rónán in church at a time of penitence when Suibhne sat with him before God to confess his sins and receive forgiveness: 'I am guilty,' said William, 'Forgive me too.' And so he spoke from top to bottom that night for every person who was worthy. He prayed fervently because this man is righteous"
"May the Lord grant you peace and prosperity in your household as well as to all who dwell therein; may He bless them with good fortune from above for their protection, health, wealth, children born of every womb that they have conceived together through His grace: let none be deprived by Him or any other angelic being. May this blessing extend over the entire world and not diminish in its fullness","May the Lord grant you peace and prosperity in your household as well as to all who dwell there with their children; may it be a blessing for them that they are blessed by God, both individually through His grace upon each one of them daily from morning till night: let none escape God's wrath nor any misfortune He has decreed against us. May the Lord grant you peace and prosperity in your household as well as to all who dwell there with their children; may it be a blessing for them that they are blessed by God, both individually through His grace upon each one of them daily from morning till night: let none escape God's wrath nor any misfortune He has decreed against us","From here to the end of this world and beyond it is a great distance; there are mountains with their own spirits above them that watch over every creature for eternity, as well as all kinds of animals in forests or meadows together","Yet no mercy is shown to them in their destruction and devastation; neither do they spare nor save anyone from falling into the abyss or being swept away by great waves, as a result of all this: let none go unharmed through it who can endure its wrath alongside those trees that stand firm beside rocks formed therefrom"
"Roscarsat rose in the morning and went to Chenn Ghabhair & Cenn Conaing. He crossed a ford of silver over an island where there was no sea until now, once he had not seen his own shadow for many days; then it did not appear again before him as long ago when they passed by Sléibhe Eidhneach and Aidneach in the morning: Roghabh said with great sorrow 'It is a terrible sight to see my children & friends on Slíabh Fúaid,' he replied, ‘but I cannot bear this pain for myself; once again it did not appear before me as long ago when we passed by.'","Roscarset rose in the morning and went to church with his wife & children. He left behind a great treasure on Slieve Mish in Emaniach, Aidneach as he had not seen it for many years since then but now saw that same mountain covered by snow; Roscar said: ‘It is wonderful how this night has changed everything,’ adding 'but I have no doubt about what you say.' He replied with a sigh of relief","The silver-tipped hawk flew over the sea until it reached a cliff on Slieve Mis in Connaught. It was not like this before when he returned after many years to his home at Murragh of Eidhneach, Aidnech, for there is no better land than Ireland; Roghabh said: 'The silver-tipped hawk that flies over the sea and cliffs until it reaches Slieve Fuad's peak - I will not leave my own country unless compelled by necessity,' he replied","Roscar was said to have a hundred and ten wives in Israel that the Lord could not number. He had many sons whom God slew on one day because his heart grew otherwise toward them after they were born, as it happened before concerning Sodom when Abraham spoke against its people; for he went there without warning us with all their possessions"

"Suibhne said to Gusine Baille that she would not be able in any way or by force from the king of Ireland against her own will; for he replied 'No,' Suibne, and did not promise him anything. He added then a story about his sister who was taken captive after this battle: She is my cousin's daughter whom I loved dearly as if she were mine myself in all things except that we are different sexes from the beginning of time until now; for he said 'Suibhne,' it seems to me, has been deprived by force.

"Darkness covered the sky as night fell upon it; stars shone brightly in their places: four suns and three moons were visible above us all together with seven constellations that could be seen from Ireland alone—seven pairs of twins among them—and a total of twelve signs, six bright ones shining through darkness. Three groups stood out clearly to the eye—the first consisting of Aries (the ram), Taurus (the bull) Gemini and Cancer; then came Leo in its place with Virgo as his companion: Libra was next followed by Scorpio which shone brightly like fireflies against a dark sky—its light piercing even into night itself, for it is said that Con Culaind shines through darkness. It appears to us now shining brilliantly bright above the clouds and appearing red at times; sometimes its rays appear white as snowflakes falling from heaven",Darkness covered the sky and all its creatures; it was as if darkness itself had come upon them: four hundred thousand souls were destroyed in one night—three hundred seventy-five thousands of angels fell from heaven—and seven hundred men died on earth at once,"Darkness covers the head of Ulaine with his hair & beard. The raven is flying over him: four wings are above and three under it; seven eyes look upon them from every direction—four in front looking at me and another set behind observing you.

And so many learned men came to it, including Lugaid Reondercc (the High King), and they settled there","In the year of our Lord's birth, Cu Chulainn went to Loch Garman and gave a great gift; he made his cloak white as snow for himself that night [which happened]. The men in Leam were astonished at him: 'He is an excellent warrior from Connacht,' they said. He was born here near the river of Ailill, son of Cairbre Nia Fer Doirm. 'This man has been prophesied,' he added; there will be no more conflict for Lugaid Rossa nor sinning at Samhain [the feast day]. Cu Chulainn replied to them that from this moment forward a great victory is destined in battle, as Luaguid Reo heard when we visited Leam. 'I know the prophecy of Flidais,' he said; she gave me nine golden apples.' Then I will go up high at Samhain's feast.'' & there was no sinning during that time"

There were also three sons of Traiglethan: Sidhe, Currach, Carman—three sons of Uasal na n-Aghra, Noisi, Ainneil and Ardán; there was Flidais, Finna, Conaill civilis—themselves descended from Scíl, Follamain, Colla Cian—a son of Neill the Little. There were also three others: Iliach, ailing—three sons of Domnall mic Rossa Mac Donngad and Dúngal; there was Ailill mac Mátaicce in Meath, Murchad Mic Rossa, Diarmait Dubthach—a son-in-law to Cormac. There were three others who came from Ireland: Conaing, Eochaid Ollam of Tara—three poets descended from Scíl Mac Lir; there was a third generation—the sons of Ailill and Maeve in Meath, Murchad Mic Rossa's children—a son-in-law to Cormac. There were also three others who came: Conaing mac Diarmait the Fair-hair—three druids descended from Art Mac Cuinn; there was a third generation—the sons of Connla Mac Lir and Eochaid Ollam, Illann's descendants","St Peter the Apostle is in heaven and there are none like him on earth: Mac Morogh of Leinster's son Cormac is among them; Conchobar, King of Munster whose wife is Airmid (not dead), daughter to Emeric. Connla mac Diarmait's sons include Congal, Corc, Connla, Cairill and many more listed in the Book of Settlements: The three great-grandsons are Lugaidh, Laegairi and Colla Fionán; Luin is accompanied by his sisters Caergaire and Cormmac ua Ruadain.

Conor Caem Chuilinn is in Tara as well: He had a descendant named Cormac Nia Neasa who bore three sons, including Lir the red-haired with his wife Fíachu Oirdne and Illann daughter to Eochaid Og; Corc Nuada son of Ros was also born there.

"These druids are not druidesses of the Cathach, nor is there any woman among them who has seen it in Falias; no one from Gorias knows its name or story: none have heard about this great treasure and knowledge that belongs to Tuatha Dé Danann","These druids are not druidesses of the Cathach; Morfessae belong to Falias, Esras to Gorias, Uiscias to Findias and Semias to Murias. It is idiosyncratic among these filid that they speak Túata Dé's words & oaths","These Druids are not the Cathach's sons, but those who fled from Ireland with Cormac son of Art Mac Cuill; they escaped to Falias and Gorias: Uiscias went there as well [with Findias]; Semias crossed over into Murias: all this occurred after these Druidic scholars had left Tara with the books & knowledge that belong thereto",Celtic druids were not Celtic Christians
"There was once Tangatar Túad Dé, who had great sorrow for Érion; he sought refuge in Feraib Bolc's fortress. Roloiscset set up his tent by the sea shore of Corcu Belgatan (i.e., Conmaicne Mara and its surrounding lands), knowing well that there is a mighty force above us both on earth, sky, water, air, fire, darkness; he sought refuge in this place for fear","At the time of Túatár Dé, Morlinges Mór was seized by Érion; Feraib Bolc captured him with great force and power in his own territory: Corcu Belgatan (i.e., Conmaicne Maraí) were subdued through cunning tactics against their enemies. In this way he gained the favor of God & Heaven for himself, as well as riches from robbing those who resisted","Temptation tempted Érion, the son of Tuad Dé and Morloinges Mór; he was unable to resist Feraib Bolc's enticement at sea (i.e., Conmaicne Mara and Inis Oírr). He saw that there were two sides in heaven as well: one side strong against evil spirits but weak before demons. Thus, temptation came upon him by the hand of Satan; he fell into sin through his lustful thoughts","Then Tángatar Túad Dé was angry with the foolish Érion, for he did not obey me even when I called upon Feraib Bolc; there is no greater warrior than Corcu Belgatan (namely Conmaicne Mara and Íar Sennen), nor any better friend or ally. He will be cursed as a sinner who commits great wrongs"

"Considered it an error, he said that this was not the case at all; 'Isn't there a better way?' asked one. Another replied: 'A feast is worth more than any other thing.'

"He is not ashamed of his lineage,' said the man. 'This Elothae son of Delpaith reigned over Fomore. He was a descendant of Bera Mac Diarmid and he took Eocha's name after him, as did all those who came before them: Magog & Dunnet & Cuirm & Coindil & Benin & Ferch & Echis Risin the sons-of-Sin Dobiter; they were not ashamed to call themselves 'Bres' in his time.'","He is not the son of Dathán; he says that Elothae Mac Delbáith was King of Fomore.

He was born in Bera Mac Diarmuid's house; his name was given to him by Eocha Bri, from Eochach Cruathach (in Erin) — and it contains many things: magi, druids, poets & singers who came with Bres when he went over there for the first time. 'As Bres gave you this name.'",They don't want to hear it
"God is the creator of eternity for Thy people Israel; He has appointed His strength in Ireland (that is, his army) to conquer and destroy its enemies.

"Dagdo was busy with his work, and Cridenbél's name is mentioned as a synonym for 'brundie'. A part of the Dagdae tribe contributed to their food supply; another portion belonged to Dagaes. As it turned out in Ireland: 'The Dagda had three treasures - one being wisdom.' The Dagda was generous with his gifts every night. Maru's name is mentioned as a synonym for 'Ireland.'

"Long ago, Dagda was in the company of Mac Nuadat and Cian mac Lugdach; 'May it be well with you,' said Dagda. Or: 'Amen' he replied to himself (in Mac Nuaid's words), or again from his own lips - 'Is this a fair price for three boars?' He asked, but the answer was not good enough ('It is too little and there will always remain some deficiency').","In the year of our Lord, Daniel was baptized by Dagda in the river Boyne near Tara Castle.

He asked again whether there was any harm done by the twofold spear of his hand against this world nor upon my people","Long ago, Dagda went to Mac Nóis with his staff in hand; he said 'Maith sin, Dagda,' or simply ‘Amin,’ from Daggad. He asked: 'What kind of harm is that? Is it the will of God?' She replied silently and then spoke quietly again - she did not wish for anyone's death except one by a mysterious force in this world"
