"Suibhne's wife was taken from the tent, and she went to Meling with her children by a Frisian man; they took all of his cattle. 'This is enough for me,' said Meling, 'I will not leave my son alive in this war against foreign kings so that I may return home.' He wished Suibhne well: he was the only one left from their family and army","Suibhne's tower was destroyed, and he went to Meling with his men; they took all the cattle in Shuibhne. 'I will avenge this for you,' said Meling, 'as long as I live I'll seek revenge on those who attacked your people.' Conor replied: Moling","Suibhne's house was the site of a gathering, and he rose to speak against them with great force; they could not withstand him. He then addressed his own people who had been silent until now about their king Gealta whose name is known for its beauty among men","Suibne's house was struck by fire, and the two brothers fled towards Limerick where they had heard their sister could find safety in a monastery. They ran to rescue them from destruction at sea while leaving behind everything else except for Suibhne; so said Colman. Conaing added: Moling continued"
"The boy was skilled in the art of war; 'As a warrior,' said Suibne, 'I would not hesitate to fight against any enemy from this world.' The boy replied, 'Do you think I am foolish and will be defeated by anyone?' 'Come here,' urged Moling. 'In my opinion, there is no one more skilled in the art of war than me: Suibhne, Mongán & myself,' said Suibne","As a boy of the school is skilled in his deeds; 'I am not afraid to fight with anyone who has fought against me from this generation,' said Suibne, 'for I have seen many great men and will be like them.' 'Come here if you wish it,' Moling replied. 'For fear that he may see us together & we shall remain as a group when the battle is over for our deeds in generations past;' Raghid éirici duit ann, .i. comhaitte comhfhaidefrium-sa for nimh dhuit,& roraidheis doraidhseist an laoid-si eatura ina triail: Suibne, Mongán & Moling",It is the boy's fault that he was captured,"The child's school was shut down because it could not maintain its appearance due to the economic situation and other difficulties; they closed all three schools including those of Suibne, Mangan, and Molling"
"Suibne's son was greatly afflicted by the plague in Connacht and he died after being ill with fever. The house of Suibhne suffered much from this, as it had been struck repeatedly over time without any remedy or cure for such a great sickness; thus his death came about through divine will: 'God willed that He should die","Suibne's son was greatly afflicted by the plague of Connacht and died in his bed without any signs or symptoms. His death left many widows, children orphaned from him all at once","Suibhne fought fiercely in the Battle of Connacht at Tullach Morainn against those who would bring ruin and destruction from afar, as his people rallied to him for battle. They spoke thus: 'Do not let your weapons fall idle until they are needed; when you march into war with great power...'",Suibne was the most lively among his friends at the court of Connacht during that time
"The Tain of Suibne the Cow-Horse in Dhuine's Court at Móling. I Teach Móling was there when Chaoimhghin played psaltery for him, and he sang a song about his long journey; 'As you have seen,' said the king to the queen: 'Móling is dead,' Suibhne declared","Suibne's son was taken by the king of Tara to be fostered in Mólin. He became skilled with psaltery and sang beautifully for his people, which pleased King Máel Sechnaill; he then sent him back home along with Suibne","Suibne's theft at the court of King Moling in Raeburn Castle was punished by having his eyes plucked out. The king said, 'As long as I live,' and ordered that Moling should be blinded along with him","Suibhin was in the company of kings at Cluain Málta, where Saint Columba lived. He gave battles to his enemies with a bow and arrows until he conquered them all"
"As the sun sets in Shuibhne's eyes at Mallow, 'I will be here and watch over you as well. I shall guard against burning suns that scorch our skin like fire, for it is a great shame each day of Ireland to see someone die from such an accident,' says Moling","As much as I can see the sun's light is with you and your shadow, so that it may be able to fly in sunshine & through firelight. And if a great ship sails every day of Easter week from Ireland towards Roscommon where they write their language,' says Moling","The thought of the sun brings Shuibhne to me and I find myself unable to bear its brightness, Moling says. Every day in Ireland a new star is born from this darkness","The fox is stronger than the lion every day in Erin; yet a clever person can trick and overcome it each night by writing its name, Moling said"
"Many years have passed since the great battle of Moling; it is said that every year, a new generation arises to avenge their ancestors' deaths and seek justice for all wrongs committed against them in Munster","Many people from Moling were killed; they are remembered for their bravery in the battle of Clontarf, where many died fighting alongside Brian Boru at that time. Muirgel was his name and he is known as a wise man who counseled him well on matters such as strategy & tactics to win battles against Suibhne's forces","Many people come to Moling; they arrive from various places, some by sea and others overland through the mountains of Connacht or Ireland's west coast. They settle in different areas around town: one group goes up into the hills near Suibhne for fishing during summer months when there is plenty left behind after catching fish with nets pulled taut at night; another stays close to Moling, where they have a permanent home and children are born here regularly","Iomthúsa the greener garden; robhaoi rises brighter, more beautiful and longer than Moling's plain at night as in Coimisiére from evening to morning by far beyond Suirneen or any other place near it but for its wealth of gold and silver hidden under that mountain. The river there flows like a fountain over the rocks with great abundance"
He who is not skilled in the art of war should stay at home and let others fight for him,"In the year of our Lord's grace and peace to you all: Muirghil spoke thusly before his brother Suibhne when he came with a cup from the well at Suibhin in search for water; 'I will fetch another one,' said Sír, 'and I shall not leave this until we find that which is missing.' He placed himself beside her and stood up to speak: 'This vessel you brought forth has been empty,' she replied. Gabhbh then spoke with his brother Suibhne about it again; he asked him why the well was dry when there had never before a drought, but Muirghil said that this time they would find water in their search for the missing one and returned to her side as if by magic: 'I will fetch another,' she repeated.

Ronan said: 'The king is justly entitled as chief ruler of all kingdoms without any doubt or fear; he may take away our possessions if necessary for a kingdom's needs which we cannot refuse nor deny to the people who are in need.'","He gave the food of his people to Ann and Doluidh, who were in exile with their tribe. Ronan said: 'The king is not worthy that he should give away this treasure which belongs by right only to those kings whose kingdoms have been conquered or diminished for a kingdom cannot be divided nor can it remain hidden from its own folk unless the enemy has taken possession of them.'","From the meal of his people and their food he took away both the strength to fight in battle against any enemy, or even if they were ill; because after all this was done by him alone without aid from anyone else","The theft of food from his people and the spoiling thereof; Ronald said: 'It is not lawful at all that this king, most universally supreme among men, should deprive our commonwealth entirely or destroy them through hunger as he did after two years to those who could neither flee nor endure it.

"Rónáin was the first to dance at Suibhne's feast when Sléibhe Fúaid arrived and took his place; he danced with great skill without a partner, neither man nor woman beside him but alone in front of everyone: 'He dances well,' said one person after another. 'Well done Ultach.' 'Very good Lenmhain.' 'Long live the dance!' cried five people together at once. He was praised by all and received many gifts from those who had come to see it, including a great cloak that he wore before anyone else; this is how they danced in Ireland: with one man dancing for every woman present","Rónáin and Dia met at the dance in Suibhne's house where Sléibhe Fúaid was present; they danced until dawn without stopping or resting their feet, singing songs of joy and gladness together: 'He is well,' said one person after another - 'I am well too,' then a third. They continued dancing throughout each day at sea for many days before returning home to the harbor with ships from all over Ireland",Here is the translation of your medieval Irish sentence,"Rest in peace Diarmuid O'Neill and your sons; may the Almighty keep you from harm's way with grace beyond measure: 'He is dead,' they said at his side, one after another - he was a great warrior who had fought against countless enemies day by night for many years without rest.

"May the Lord protect you from harm and evil; may He keep your head safe against all blows of sword or spear that might strike it in battle for His glory, as well as Your life itself: May You be a stronghold to them who are fleeing before Him with their children, livestock, possessions. And let not any enemy take away the lives from those whom they have taken captive at war","May peace and prosperity be upon you in the face of adversity; may your children grow strong with wisdom from their ancestors' experiences as they navigate life amidst mountains, rivers, forests, seas, winds, storms, lightning strikes, thunderbolts, rainstorms, hailstones falling down to earth - for all creatures great or small are subject to these forces and must endure them","May the light of your eyes shine forth as far and wide through all creation; may it be a guide to you in wisdom & understanding for every living creature, great or small: from fish to birds flying across skies above us—may none escape its reach",The forest was full of bears and wild boars; tall trees stood near rivers with dense undergrowth for birds to nest in on them all year round

Conor answered angrily: ‘The darkness before us today was worse than last night's,’ saying his own words were evil; then Adbert said to him","Roghabh said to him that the night is dark and full of shadows & darkness on Slieve Fáil. 'I cannot see well in such a place,' he replied, 'but I will try my best as long as you are here with me; I'll look after myself too.'

Aidneach is nearby it in its place since that time, as told by those who have seen this before me","Roghabh was struck by fear upon seeing the sea's waves crashing against the rocky cliff on Oile Island in its mighty form from before this time.

"Suibhne said to him that he was not a thief and would never betray them with his tongue. 'As for me,' Suibhne replied, 'I have seen women after such battles; it is good enough my counsel among the fair maidens of this kindred, two by one through courage & strength: Oillil Cédach, son of Ua Fhaoláin, a man well-versed in speaking.' And so he said to her again","Suibhne said to him that he was a fool in his own mind and would not be able to bear the sound of this bell for them; but Suibhne replied saying it is good my heart, as I have seen women after such battles. It may well please me if you take care over these two maidens who are both beautiful: one with her golden hair & another with a red complexion - and they were born on the day of Oilill Cédach, son of Ua Fhaoláin; he was killed by my father","It is said that Suibhne's daughter fell from the horse in a battle with Eorann and his men. 'Son,' replied Eorann, 'and I will speak to each of you.' She added afterwards: 'I do not wish for your blood,' she told him again; 'nor should we fight against one another.' Suibhne said afterward that it was her fault because a young woman had come between them after the battle. Good enough is my counsel about this same fair maiden, and I would have you see both of us with two eyes at once in peace: Eorann's brother, Oilill Cédach, fell bravely when he fought against me; so there was added afterwards","And then Suibhne the son of Bóinn went to sea with his ship and brought back great treasures from all places; that was well for me in my thoughts about a beautiful lady, I would gladly take her as wife if you had one ready like this. 'O God,' said Sheilbhne, 'I wish your mind were troubled by these visions.' He went down to sleep while his men sang songs and recounted their stories; they spoke of the battle between Mac Art mac Muiredaig Ruadh Robh (Red-haired) son of Ailello Cille at Tír Eoghain near Fál. That was well with me, it seemed as if my thoughts were troubled by this vision"
"As I am a man of the Irish language and knowledge, it is said that he who speaks with wisdom will be blessed by God; for those wise men are called to speak well about Ireland's past glory when they have learned from their elders in peace","As I am a humble servant of the Lord Jesus Christ and my hope is set on Him alone; let me be content with this Concoboir, which has given us peace from fear as well as faith through love for God our Father in heaven: In no way have we abandoned His Concobor or its riches. The Ulaid Ulster are still there today","As I am a poor man from the city of Dublin and not one who has been to Rome or Constantinople; for my belief is that Christ was born here, though some say he came into existence elsewhere after his birth in Bethlehem: so also at this Concoboir [Synod], we have learned much.

Three others took refuge beneath Con Culaind's rock where he had built his dwelling; there was the entrance and exit door through which one entered when darkness fell upon them","Darkness fell upon the world and all its creatures; it was as if night had come over everything: seven stars in heaven were extinguished (two of them), three suns disappeared from their places - one went into hiding for some time while another remained hidden behind a veil until they returned to light. Seven constellations vanished, leaving only four visible ones and six that are still with us today; the constellation Con Culaind: it was as if night had come over everything again",Do not fear the wrath of Cu Chulainn; he is as strong in battle with his spear and sword like fire and flood against enemies or thieves who dare to approach him,The fair and noble Cu Chulainn rode his white horse that gleamed like the sun; he was skilled at battle with spear or bow but never used shield as armor

He then went to Coire Luachra where there is a great feast for those coming from afar: they will be given food as well as drink at the banquet","In the year of Ulstergate and Conculaind's death, when men died by plague or battle at sea against him for his sake; he sought out his own revenge with great cunning through various means such as treachery in war to gain power over others. And so it was that many kings were killed on account thereof","After the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 AD between King Brian Boru and Muirchertach Ua Briain for his daughter Máire Bóroimhe's hand, as well as other matters related to her marriage with Cormac Mac Art. This also refers to a story that is now considered ancient: the Red Swords of Connacht were hidden in various places on Earth by those who feared Muirchertach Ua Briain"
"Conchobar of Connacht did not dare challenge the king in battle, nor would he strike him with a spear or throw stones at his head and neck; instead, when Conchobar came from Ireland for war against King Colman of Dalriada's army","Conchobar of Connacht did not kill a man in Ireland for the sake of his own people, but rather because he was forced by those from Cooley and their leader's oath; Conchobar then returned with them","Conchobar of Connacht, the son of Colman Dúich, was not a king in Ireland nor did he seek counsel or protection from any foreign power for his own kingdom and people","Conchobar of Connacht will not take a life from Erin without the consent first and foremost, nor seek death with his spears or any other weapon against them unless they attack us as well at their camp along Loch Luimnigh; he is obliged by honour to give due consideration before launching an assault on our encampment there"

"Scáthach, the daughter of Coin Culaind and Nu-Sforcelda Scathach's son in law, was a woman who had many lovers from Munster; she bore children by Lughaidh mac Nois Mac Alamaic with Coiccell Con Culainn (i.e., Comalta) Dilligh Indiar & Dá Errig.

"Scathaig's daughter Aife came to claim her inheritance from Aeife and the other women of Erin, but Scáthach said: 'You shall not have it unless you can outwit me.' She retorted that she could best Aeife in wit as well; then they both sat down together. Scathaig replied: 'I am a woman too,' saying so herself. 'My mind is always with my husband, and I will never leave him for another man or his children after he dies.' Aife said to her mother-in-law that she would not be separated from Aeife; then they both sat down together again in the same way as before when Scáthach was born until death. Scathaig replied: 'I am a woman too,' saying so herself, and added: 'My mind is always with my husband.' She said to her mother-in-law that she would not be separated from Aeife; then they both sat down together again in the same way as before when Scáthach was born until death.

The battle ended with many slain on both sides. Asbert spoke to Aiffe and his warriors who fought valiantly against the odds for their king's sake without fear of death or injury; Scathaig said: 'You have done well, my friend,' he added, 'and you will be remembered in history as those brave men from Connacht.' Facbaiss Cu Chulaind spoke to them and his warriors who fought bravely against the odds for their king's sake without fear of death or injury; they were not defeated by Scathaig but rather killed many on both sides. They also slew a great number of Aiffe's forces, leaving no survivors","Scathaig demanded Aife's hand in marriage for her wealth and beauty, but she refused him with pride: 'I will not marry you unless I have your father's consent,' he said; Scáthach replied to the king of Connacht on behalf of Cú Chulainn & Aife that they would gladly accept his proposal if their friends were allowed. The man returned home in anger and told them, saying that there was no need for him or anyone else to marry her unless she wanted it herself","Aife sought help from Scathaigh for the fair of Aiffe and Eimercofind, but when she could not find one to marry her in his absence or die fighting him instead, with only three men remaining at Erin's side who would be willing as friends if there was any woman left among them. 'Do you have a friend?' Scathaigh asked after that; the others answered nothing while he spoke about Ireland and its people... 'And I will speak my name in this hall,' said one, although no women were remaining to hear it nor anyone from all of Connaught willing enough for any woman there to be brought back or married. There was a great feast held at Tara where Aife's companions stayed; she went out with them and her maid-servants... 'My people are in trouble tonight,' said one, but Scathaigh answered nothing so they left him alone as he began his speech"
"At the beginning of this year, I am a young man who has never been in battle or war for my country and faith; but now I've come to fight against those enemies that have invaded our land from all sides with their armies: they are destroying everything we love here as well as killing us.

Behold him with the treasure of Crofooid, as I have seen his cunning deceit among those seeking them; do not trust anyone who seeks it for their own gain: 'It would be a great loss if such treasures were found in Ireland,' said Cuchulainn! He spoke thus from Ath na Imfhóid","Do not trust Cu Chulaind with Crofooid's treasure, nor should you name it to him; he would take your gold and silver treasures from each of the dead for his own use as payment in full at Ath Imfhoid for Boinn. He will also steal all other valuables that are buried there","King Cu Chulainn of Crookedwood is the greatest warrior ever known, and his name will endure forever in Ireland; he was a master archer who could shoot arrows without aiming at any target but still hit them perfectly as if by magic—this I heard from Ath n-Imfhoid. He told me that it happened to Cu Chulainn when they were fighting against the people of Aghnacloich, and this is why he was given a spear for his bravery in battle","The Lord of Heaven is above his adversaries, and the name that he will take in this life against them all shall be great; a God among gods to behold by those who fear him: And such was He when they called upon Him from heaven for Boinn's sake - Emhyr had with her some words as she stood before His enemies. May it also become known, what kind of gifts the Lord gave unto men and angels in Heaven above"

'I will give you land as your reward and leave behind me the town of Conopar, which I have built to protect against enemies; let us now be silent here until we meet again.' Then they sat quietly in front of him at Braine-aux-Bois discussing their plans for a united defense with all his army","He who comes to you will come and he that stays at your house, unless there is sickness or death among us"
"At the same time, Cathfad said to Bricne: 'I will give you two sons against your wife if she is not faithful.' Conchobar replied, 'You shall have one hundred cows and all their milk from Sleipnir's stall for a year as compensation in place of Cú Chulaind. And I swear by the gods that he has no right to claim any part thereof without my consent","And now, Cathfad said: 'Eight years have passed since Brice came to the monastery of Cluain Bhríde; two brothers from Cu Chulainn died in battle against Faith's people,' he added. Conchobar replied, 'Two men fell by his hand.' And so did Cu Chulaind and never again would they be seen together without a fair face & eyes all bright as the sun of Sleipnir or ever more than once with their heads bowed low before faith in Emain Mor","At the same time, Cathfad said to Bricne: 'I will not agree with you against your wife unless she is from my own people and of noble birth.' Conchobar replied, ‘God knows what I would say about such a thing.’ Then Cu Chulainn spoke again. 'She was beautiful,' he continued, 'and fairer than the sun or moon in all her beauty as seen by Sleipnir for me to come with my wife instead of you from Emain.' He then went on tirelessly and said: ‘I will never agree that a woman be taken away against your consent.’ And Conchobar was angry again. Teid didiu, he ordered the soldiers not to take Cu Chulainn's horses","In vain we strive, Cathfad said; yet as it is decreed that the blind man Bricne shall name us in battle tomorrow (but not this day), I will tell you so myself: Go to ruin and be broken by Cu Chulaind! Conchobar exclaimed 'Thou wretch!' For thou dost bear a bitter malice against me for nothing, said Conan. He told the blind man of many things that he had seen with his eyes before meeting Leofric's woman in secret; I will tell you so myself: 'I swear by my soul and all that's good I'll never speak to your mistress again unless she has faith towards Emain.' So it is not true, for Conan did indeed give the blind man a false word against Cu Chulaind"
"Many of the tales I heard from Ulltair, king of Connacht: Emer told me about Conchobar at Tara and Fergus and Cathbad who spoke to him in secret; Fomorian warriors came with a great army against us that year too – many stories were shared among them all. Conchobor was praised by the Irish as an archer for his skill, but he did not return home until after they had taken Dublin from him","Many of the people I have seen in Ulltair are not as strong, but it is said that Emer was stronger than Conchobar at Feis Laumuad and Fercus and Cathfad when he came to Ireland with his men; they say many years ago a group from Conn Culaind arrived here. The sons of Coirpre were in the army against him: one called himself King of Emain Macha, another was named Conchobar son of Eochaid Mugmedon","The invaders did not come alone; they had Fergus and Cathbad, the sons of Conchobar, with them to lead their army against us in battle","When I first looked at Ulltair Immon's banner, it was red and white; this is what the Irish said: 'Emer did foray against Concobhar at sea with Fercus & Cathfad a n-oinlepaid frivolously to challenge Con Culaind & Bennoch Vlad of his family. In those days also there were many battles. Connacht's sons, Coillan and Fergus Mac-Rothach, fought bravely together; their banner was red-brown with white stars shining brightly.' That is how Emer conquered Erin: the son of Colman had a terrible battle for it"
St. Patrick's Day is celebrated in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine,"At the court of King Cennach Macraidi Vlad in Coind, there was great strife and turmoil: Conchobar son of Conn of the Hundred Battles ruled over Ulster; his sons were Ailill Finn, Eochaid Ollathair, and Iucharba.

Fergus Mac Róich and Fergus son of Deirdre were great warriors, as well as Cormac mac Art daughter of Cathbad from Coind, who was also known by the name Maev; there lived many other kings such as Conchobar son of Eochu Ollathair in Leinster. Ailill Finn had three sons: Lóegaire Luigdecht and his brothers Curcach, Cormac mac Airt, Mac Duagh, Dunchad, and Domnall Brecc; Fergus was the king over Connacht with a golden head like that of Roderic son of Crimthann. There were also three sons from Tríthechán: Sidil, Carman, and Aisling; there lived many other kings such as Conor mac Nessa who had two brothers named Lóegaire Luigdecht and his brother Cormac Mac Airt in Leinster","St. Patrick drove the shadows of Mac Raidi Vlad from Coind Cuilend; he and his son were slain in this battle: Mac Raidi, an army leader, died with Cráebradha, Furpaide, Finn on the plain, Cumsaid is Cunmaglaed's brother-in-law who married Mael Scoth of Dún Dechtire. Fergus mac Leithnasa was a poet and warrior; he also had three sons: Fearghus son of Lethnaig in Gallae, Feredach son of Dergall Mac Finn, and Furmascán son of Cormac.

These men are numerous among those who have been blessed with horses"

He also granted him lands of gold, silver, bronze, iron, copper, lead, tin, antimony, lapis lazuli, carnelian, agate, amethyst, emeralds, beryl, topaz, garnet, onyx, sapphire, ruby, diamond, coral, amber and pearls.

"Dagdo was busy with his work, and Cridenbél's name is mentioned as a synonym for 'island', which means the same thing in Irish; it also says that Dagda had two sons: one named Cernunnos (or Crom Dubh) from Dagda himself. The second son came after him when he was born on an island, where his mother gave birth to her child by a tree's shadow at midday and then returned home with the boy in tow; she also mentions that Dagda had three sons who were sent out into exile","Dagdo was busy with his work, and Cridenbél's name is said to be in the same breath as Brundie's. It seems that a part of Dagda came from him at birth; he had three children born on different days: one day they were born dead but revived later by Dagda himself when someone asked for them back after their death, and another child was conceived through an apple falling to earth which became pregnant with the seed inside. He also gave a part of his body as payment in exchange","Dagdo and Cridenbél were busy with work, but it was Dagda who finished first; he received the blessing of three blessings for his people every morning in exchange from Dagdhu. The beautiful Dagda gave a gift to each person at nightfall as if they had met him face-to-face","He came with Dan the warrior to work, and he took as a pledge Daul Esba's spear; his name was Cridenbél, who lived by sword in Brundie. He gave part of what belonged to Craignphél and another from Dagdae himself. When we met at first, ‘Dagdae,’ I told him there is no difference between the three thousand days before death for anyone except our lives! Good night now you have your evening; tomorrow it will be my morning by turn .i. one month in each season. Daulae took his pledge of their part among them"
"Long ago, the Dagda said to Mac Nuadat: 'I am not afraid of you,' or in Mac Nuad's language. 'Amen' he replied from Daghda; and then asked him what kind of drink it was that made a man so strong as three men could never break his bones.'","Lo and behold, Dagda stood before Mac Og in the court of Tara with his staff raised high; 'Behold me,' he said. The king asked him a question: 'What is your name?' He replied to them both that it was not for their knowledge but rather because they were seeking wisdom from one who had seen many ages and knew much about all things","Long ago did the Dagda speak to Mac Og of Ulster, saying 'Peace be with you,' or in Magh Oir. ‘Amen,’ he said from Daghda. ‘What do you seek?’ asked Seachnanus. ‘A treasure hidden beneath a mound by two men who quarrelled and left no trace except for the stone marking their boundary.’","Láu n-ann didiu ba en Dagda íns an Chétchathach co na Cídhge, or in Mac Og.

He said to Suibhne who is now a beggar without eyes or ears for women: 'I am not afraid,' replied the blind man, 'of any woman that comes into my house with her children.' Then he spoke again saying: ‘My blindness came from two springs of Sionainn,’ and it was written in verse as follows","Suibhne's cattle were driven away by the chill from Snámh two Én for Sionainn, and Cluain Boirenn was ruined; a great famine struck Ireland. As Suibhne drove his herd of cows to the sea or river with women on their backs & children in arms against him: 'I will not give my eyes,' said Suibhne, 'to your son who has destroyed all our cattle.' He replied again and again that he would never let go until they had taken away every last cow from his land at night. The famine continued for seven years","The thief Suibhne was near the river Shannon when he saw a woman bathing by herself, with neither man nor boy to guard her. 'I don't recognize your eyes,' said Suibhne; 'they are not those of Cormac son of Conor.' He then spoke again and told his men: ‘These women have no husbands,’ saying that they were daughters-in-law from the sons of Brian Boru, who had come here at night.’","Suibhne came before him and offered his cold shoulder to Sionainn, who said he was a man of peace. 'I would not give my eyes for the house,' Suibhne replied, 'and I wish you health as well.'
