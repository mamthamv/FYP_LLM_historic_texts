"There was a great tumult in the land of Suibhne & it rained, Moling went out to fetch a goose as he had done before & pulled out a stone from each man who lay on the ground of Suibhne. 'The fairies are taking away that man,' said Moling, 'I know because I saw him in my dream last night when we were speaking at the end of the winter so. He was taken by the fairy woman to the top of the hill which is called Tuileann Gealt a hainm, namely it is the place where the fairies dwell & the day is dark & the night is light & the women are in the house & the men are outside and I saw all other people who were not Suibhne'; thus Moling said to him","The king has fallen asleep in my bed, and the birds have flown away like before, and the stones are pulled out of every man's house in Suibhne. 'The fox is sleeping under that leek,' says Moling, 'I am waiting for him to come out of his conversation with the night of the conaire so. I wish good luck to you, Suibhne; I have seen it, namely, that he will be taken from this place on the 1st of January, i.e., Tiupra tiopratna Gealta, which is named after the man who has not been killed by the day, and the night, and the woman, and the child, and the dog, and the cat; all the other omens are bad for Suibhne,' says Moling","The poet was lamenting the death of Suibhne & he rose up, and his voice was like the sound of a mournful clarinet as he pulled out a stone from each man in Leath Shuibhne. ‘The great spirit of the fairy is the one who has taken him to the land of the dead,’ said Moling, ‘for I know that it is not safe for anyone to converse with this fellow after sundown on the eve of his burial so. He was a wicked man in my opinion, i.e. he had taken the body of Suibhne to the great pit, namely Tiuprat na Gealta which is called by the name of the fairies & the ones who dwell there are the guardians of the night; and every other spirit or demon was present at that place with regard to Suibhne’; thus Moling spoke","Moling found a stone cairn for Suibhne and made it ready, like the others & placed stones at each of Suibhne's lairs & said 'The raven is guarding this spot,' said Moling, 'I know that a brave man would not be in danger talking to his own kind by the side of that cairn; I wish them well, namely this cairn standing alone in winter; I am not one who knows its name - that is, the stone cairn's name, which has no owner & there is nothing guarding it besides a midge in the night. Moling offered each other good wishes for all other travellers as well, namely Suibhne; he said this to him:"
There was a young servant who wished to be free,"There will be no battle today, my boy","As soon as you will die, I will be waiting for you on the field of battle with my spear of gold and my armor of red",The boy will be slain
"He will be in Connacht until the end of the month, when he will come to the hall of the All-Father in Tír Fhíachrach Mhúaidhe; with a stream flowing gently, a river flowing swiftly, and a sea crashing against the shore, with a mighty wave rising up & a great whirlpool forming there, beneath a sacred cairn & a holy well, where he will find peace & rest, for it was there that he rested. There is a tree of knowledge standing tall, bearing great wonders in its shade; and he will dwell there, in the midst of his people, with a mighty fortress, until the end of his life, if the nobles do not drive him out from that place, where the sea meets the land & the mountain rises up, for it was there after he came out of the great ocean in that place","They will be hanged in the courtyard of Suibhne at Connacht until they reach the end of the road to the land of Fharanna, the foreigners; the glen is full of birds, the stream is full of trout and salmon in that place, there are no holy wells or shrines there, but a grave & a tomb, and it was there that I buried him, with his head towards the west. There was a great oak tree standing on that hill, its branches reaching to the sky, its roots deep into the earth; it was there that he lay sleeping, a great man & wise in counsel, who would have been a king if he had lived, but he died there after being thrown from the sea, which was full of waves & foam & great turmoil, and it was there that I saw him, Suibhne, with great sorrow, when he reached his home, going to take his final breath; go sing this song","It was raining on Suibhne as he was cutting the hedge in Connacht to reach the hall of Hudmhall, which is at the foot of the All Fharannáin land, the land of Fíachrach Mhúaidhe; a pleasant glen, a swift stream, red streams running through it § this is the place where he would find his holy shrine & relics co hiomdha iolarrdha, et ba hiomdha annp.  a mighty oak tree standing there in its sacredness & strength & beauty co hiomda ann éimh eidheann  fíorchluthmar & aball cenntrom ag cromadh co  talmain le troma a toraidh, ba cuma nobhíttís isin  allt sin ois allta & míola muighe & muca mórthroma,  ba hiomda immorro rón roiremhar rochodladh ann  tar éis techt ó muir móir anall isin all sin. Roshann~taigh  Suibhne co mór an t-ionadh sin, go roghabh  for adhmoladh & ag tabhairt a thúarusgbhála ós  aird; go ndébairt an laoidh-si","They would not find Suibhne at the crossroads of Connacht, going to the great hall in which was a marvel that could only be found on one side of All Fharannáin land in Fiachraich Mhumhan; where glens were filled with streams, and rivers flowed with azure over the silver streams; an ascent & descent of this mountain were holy places & fiery springs were hidden there, it was not known to anyone in that place. There was a mighty oak tree standing on one side, bearing wonderful luck, isin all hisin. It was said there that an eagle dwelled there, and every year would go to its lair on the great rock in the land of that mountain, after traveling from a sea far away from it. The fortress of Suibhne stood in the midst of those hills; with its mighty walls, not known to any in all those lands, it was considered an immovable wonder there, after being built out of the biggest stones, and after many years of work from those of great strength; no one dared approach that fortress; but the song said:"
"They say that Suibhne was in the house of Moling, which is called Teach Moling. It was a long time since he had come to Moling. He brought with him a psalter of St. Columba to the people of the monastery. They say that Suibhne was found in the sraith of the tipperary in the forest of Cléirigh & he caught and ate a bird. 'That is my long life,' said the cleric; then spoke Moling & replied Suibhne:","They say that Suibhne was in the house of Moling. He had not been there before. That is where I found a psalter of St. Columba in the church of Moling, and he gave it to all those who sought it. They say that Suibhne was in the choir of the church, and he took up the psalter & read from it. 'That is my long life,' said the priest; and then told Moling & replied Suibhne:","When Suibhne was in hiding in the town of Moling, that is, Teach Moling. He had not been there long. Then he stole a psalter of St. Caomhghin and brought it to Moling with some of the monks' possessions. When Suibhne was in the monastery's kitchen eating meat, 'That was a good day,' said the cleric; then told Moling and Suibhne:","Moling had Suibhné from a distant town come to the town in Moling. It was not long before he received Psalms of St. Columba in Moling for himself, and for the people of the community. Soon after that, Suibhne went into the forest near the stream, and caught a salmon there; and the priest said: 'It was a fortunate catch,' said the priest; Moling replied to Suibhné:"
"As much as I am in need of you, Shuibhne,' says Moling, 'as there is a burden on you, so too are your joys, your words, and the comfort that will be yours when you depart from this world, and the peace that will be yours in the otherworld, & the inheritance of the fort,' says Moling, 'there is a great sorrow for each day that Ireland loses its virtuous men, who have been taken from us.'","As much as I am in need of your protection, so too is Shuibhne,' says Moling, 'for you have a gift for me & a blessing to be found, the light to escape from darkness & the comfort to be gained, the peace that is kept in the fire-places, & the treasure that is mine, I am grateful for this great land of Ireland, which has been given to us all as an inheritance","As much as I love my son, says Moling, 'the one who has been with you is blessed & the joy of your presence is with you, the shelter from the storm & the protection of faith, that you may be safe in this world, and the peace of God be with you,' says Moling, 'a great shire for each day to be a refuge for us, as long as the roof of our homes remains solid.'","A soft evening mist is falling over you, dear Suibne,' says Moling, 'because you are in a state of comfort and peace, having escaped the harshness of life & its troubles, the darkness & the evil that might have driven you to despair, & for this I take refuge in holy places, & my heart is at one with fortresses.' says Moling, 'a great fortune falls on each house every day that escapes the darkness.'"
"I will go to the geese in the evening; may God be with me that night at Moling. May it be calm on the Innsish Bó Finni in Connacht, calm on the rocháoin Rúaidh, calm on Slíabh mínálainn Mis, and calm going to the land of Boirche; may God protect us from every evil and every night that we spend at Moling's house. May Moling have mercy on this child, for he was taken by a fairy, Muirghil, who was his foster-father, and it is said that the child was nourished with milk in the cowshed until he had grown up to be strong as Suibhne. It is a wonder that I am still alive in the midst of those cattle that drank from that well","I will go to the geese in the evening; may God be with me that night at Moling. May it be calm on the Inns of Bó Finni in Connacht, calm on the shores of Ruaidh, calm on the slopes of Mínáilinn's Hill, calm on the banks of Boirche's Ford; may God protect us from every evil and misfortune that we encounter each night to Moling. May Moling have mercy upon those who are in need of this prayer, for he will know when they do not return with their cattle to him. Muirghil, son of the sidhe, as if it were a cow belonging to Mhungán was killed by Moling. It is said that the mercy of that prayer was bestowed on him, i.e., the nodhingedh which he raised above his head in the midst of the whirlwind, with many lemnachs and blessings to Suibhne. May God forgive us for our sins in the great whirlpool of the cattle of that milk","I shall give the geese in winter; and it is said that Moling will catch them at Inis Bó Finni in Connaught, on one day with the roe deer of Inis, on another day with the wild boar of Rúaidh, on another day with Slíabh mínálainn Mis, and on another day with the Ben of Boirche; that is to say, they will be given every day, every night, to Moling's table.  Moling ordered a big fish for this occasion, thinking that it would be good to deprive him of his cattle. The name Muirghil was given to him, as it was said he had killed Moling. It is an evil thing that the benn was given to him; i.e. the nodhingedh which was planted above the hill with a high spring in the well of Suibhne. They give thanks to this event in the feast of the cows on the riverbank where the milk of the white cow came",I would have eaten the goose in the winter; perhaps I will again at Moling's house
"They will be married in Muirghil & the woman will stay with her husband until she dies: 'As to you,' he says, 'there is no touch of your other self & yet there is no touch of your own self in that marriage; surely the castle is not far from that place & if Muirghil stays in it alone, then he will be driven mad by his loneliness while drinking wine at Suibhne's house which is most pleasant for the child. O'Donnairc surely knows that castle & tells his brother: 'Your sister is in that castle with the man, a midwife,' he says. The youth was amazed by that story, & became restless & took his hand to go out & eat at the gate. As much as I know of the geilt & his wife & they are living together in that marriage. Take the young man to the door of the castle with your right hand, for it is said that he will be driven mad by Suibhne's treachery, for he got permission to pass through the woman's womb on that day","They will be married in the church of Muirghil & the women will stay inside until the other woman says: 'As for you,' she said, 'there is no touch between you and him & yet there is not a touch between you and yourself because that highness has given permission to marry them this year.' They are sure about the blessing in that place & they do not know how Muirghil will go to the well of the milk to fetch water for the feast which will be pleasant for the children. The priest is sure about it & he told his brother: 'The woman is inside the cow, a midwife,' she said. He was delighted with that and took his hand back from the rope & went for the food of the guests. As the priest had promised to give them the best place at the table, they would take their seat on the left side of the child, because it was given by Suibhne, because he gave permission through him to marry them this year. They were afraid of the boy & his mother & she 'will be taken care of' as if she were a servant in the cowshed. The boy will give you the best place at the table, so that you may eat from the left side of the child, because it was given by Suibhne, because he gave permission through him to marry them this year. They are afraid of the priest & his wife & she 'will be taken care of' as if she were a servant in the cowshed. The boy will give you the best place at the table, so that you may eat from the left side of the child, because it was given by Suibhne, because he gave permission through him to marry them this year","The old woman said to him, 'As for you, I will not touch the milk from this cow of yours and your wife's until the stranger comes in with his own milk: 'May it be good luck to you,' she replied, 'for if it is not good luck to me when I give away my own milk in exchange for butter at the market of Suibne, then the cow will fall ill.' The old woman was certain about that and told her brother: 'The cow is standing there thirsty, a poor thing,' said she. The youth looked at that with great longing & was eager to reach out his hand to touch it & get some butter. As for the stranger & his wife, they were waiting in secret & were thinking of taking away their milk from this cow. You take all the milk on your own hand, until you have taken a share of the cow's bone, that is Suibne's, where he had been buried, & you may get safe passage through it. The old woman was certain about that, but unfortunately she died soon after, for she gave away her own milk to the stranger in exchange for butter","They say Tarla is about to get married to Muirghil's daughter, and the wife of Muirghil will be left in it, until she meets her other half: ‘To me you are’ says he, ‘not touched by any other man & still not touched by that man who would have taken my wife in marriage as if she were high-born. Atchúala surely a noble one like that, and no one has seen Muirghil in the meadow without his bride, going to Suibhne's land with his herds being most pleasant to those having cows there.  O'dchonnairc surely such a thing is happening & he spoke to his brother: ‘The woman is standing by the well that I watered, and she would have been an excellent match for my cattle.’ The boy saw that wonderful sight, & was taken with wonder & reached out his hand towards it & went there with great desire & took away the cows. As amhlaidh he had a dream & was brought before the king & said to him: ‘Tuccad dono an buachaill sadhudh don leathgha as a láimh fair, gur rosgon a n-odhar a chíghe clé antí Suibhne, gur gabh urrainn tríd ar mbrisedh a droma ar dhó ann. Adberat foirenn conadh benn chongna fíadha ro-innell an búachaill fáoi, áit a n-ibhedh a dhigh asan mbúall~trach, co tæth-somh furri, conadh amhlaidh fúair bás"
"They have taken him from the crowd to his death & they are mourning over his body & they say that Ronán saw that day when he was in his place & he wished to be going with his people, but Ronán said: 'I am not worthy of all the power of the King who has given me this gift which I have been longing for a long time to fight for my people, and the inheritance of the kingdom which they would give me, & that the King's mercy would be upon them, not on his enemies, nor on those who would take it from them by force, but rather that he would give it to them in peace, as is their right, or as a gift from heaven, for two days they did not stir from their vigil, waiting for the people of the kingdom, until Ronán said: 'I am not worthy of all the power of the King who has given me this gift which I have been longing for a long time to fight for my people, and the inheritance of the kingdom which they would give me, & that the King's mercy would be upon them, not on his enemies, nor on those who would take it from them by force, but rather that he would give it to them in peace, as is their right, or as a gift from heaven.'","They will be in the land of their kin, and they will have joy over it, until they reach the place where their father is buried, and their mother's soul is at peace. Ronán said that day to Suibhne: 'I am the king of all noble power who has not betrayed the memory of his ancestors' blood, which was shed in long battles, and the inheritance of our people, so that there should be no shame nor fear for them, but rather a great glory when they reach their land, and their souls are at peace, as if they were never to tire of seeking it, until the day when they will not have to strive anymore for the inheritance of their kin, nor will they be troubled by any evil or sorrow, for two days' journey from that place, where our ancestors are buried, there is no fear nor shame.'","Those who know the truth will be driven out of this land by the enemy, and those who are left will be tormented at their homes & they will be hated by my people & by all that is dear to them. Ronan told me that day what was in his mind when he saw Suibhne's body & how he was going with it to his people, but Ronan said: 'I am the King of all the powerful who have never betrayed their faith for a single moment & I will not rest until I have avenged my family's death & the slaughter of my people, unless Rónán: 'I am the Lord of all the noble & great kings who have never been defeated in battle  & who have always had the courage to fight for their people, nor has anyone ever tormented them, nor has anyone ever taken away from them a single member of their family.","The lord of the house has gone to visit his kin, and Doluidh roams over it with the sound of their footsteps do reach your door, and his mind is in his mother's grave. It is said that Ronán was at that time thinking about Suibne & being about to go to his kin's burial ground, not knowing Rónán:‘I will not let the Lord Almighty of all strength see the sorrow within my soul for it has been enough for me to fight a thousand battles with the eagles' flesh and the longing to be free from this land  & the inroads made by Día fair is about to go out of my heart, leaving my kin without any comfort, nor any peace that they do not find for a moment, nor let them take a step to go back to it, because they would find it harder than if they had died immediately. And with this thought I am about to leave the Coilmích's land, not for my kin"
"They said to the Lord of Ireland that in the time when the sons of Suibne were slain on Slieve Fuaid, they had been robbed of their chariot and their horses, namely five hundred maidens, without a man among them, except one who was blind and lame. They said: 'A beggar,' on the hill. 'A beggar Uladh,' on the second hill. 'A beggar with good luck,' on the third hill. 'The beggar is far away,' on the fourth hill. 'There's no fair weather for them,' on the fifth hill. The sons of Áed had a great sorrow over this. They said: 'We have been robbed.' We will go to each of the hills and see if we can find any sign of them & may God protect us & all","They said to the Lord that they were not at home with Suibne of Medhón Sléibhe because he had killed his father and mother, and was not in possession of either, but was wandering in solitude and fasting, without food or drink, on the mountain and in the glen. They asked him: 'Is he a thief?' On the first hill. 'A robber,' on the second hill. 'A good man,' on the third hill. 'He is long gone,' on the fourth hill. 'No one has seen him,' on the fifth hill. He had not been seen by any of us, except for the lord of the board who was present and his own servant beside him","They were speaking of Suibne, son of Rónáin, who had wandered into the slope of Sléibh Fúaid and had been robbed by the fairies there, to whom he showed his arms in a futile attempt to ward off their enchantments, namely, the sight of a thousand midges, the stinging of a hundred gorse thorns, the feeling of no body, no limbs, on the ground, in the air & in the mist; and they said: ‘He is a fool,’ on one hill. ‘A wretch,’ on the second hill. ‘A very good man,’ on the third hill. ‘The length of the fairies’ path is far,’ on the fourth hill. ‘Not to be trusted,’ on the fifth hill. They took pity on his mother's grief. The fairies gave him food. We will offer prayers to each other every day until we meet again & may God guard us all & keep us safe","It was the day of Ronan's death, when Suibhne stood on Slieve Fúaid mountain to warn others about the perils of that place; namely the bloodshed among his kinsfolk in which there were no survivors, no women left, no corpses or souls, no sleep, and no peace. They all spoke in anger: 'He was a coward,' said one hill. 'Gelt Ultach' ('Ullard,' or 'Bold'), said the second hill. 'A lenmhain co maith,' ('Goodly Raven,' or 'Fair Bird'), said the third hill. 'Gurab fada an lenmhain,' ('The raven was long,' or 'Long-lived Raven'), said the fourth hill. 'Nógo ría fairrge' ('No good from it,' or 'Bad Fortune'), said the fifth hill. They lamented his untimely death: 'We took you up to that mountain.' 'You were our companion in conversation.' 'A lenmhain co maith, gurab fada an lenmhain' ('Goodly Raven, The raven was long')."
"The world is not without darkness and evil, but the good people are strong and brave, for they have faith in their hearts and in their souls, so that there may be peace among them & among all men & women & those who dwell on earth & in heaven, for it is treasured & cherished by the trees & by the hills of stone & by the rivers & by the streams & by the mountains & by the sea & by the land & by the air, so that no one may be without hope & comfort, until all men are at peace with each other & with themselves, and with God","The world is not without darkness, but our ancestors were brave and strong, who in the face of adversity and hardship, found strength and courage in their hearts and souls, so that they could stand firm against all kinds of hardships and dangers, both from within and from outside, for every tree and rock, for every hill and mountain, until none remained unscathed","Dearly beloved of the Irish nation, I greet you from the land of saints and scholars, where the wise men dwelled in harmony with nature and the elements, who were blessed with the gift of prophecy and the light of knowledge","A great wind was coming from the west, with fierce waves and heavy rain, strong gusts and powerful storms"
"It was a beautiful evening in the spring when I first saw the fairies playing on the slopes of Slieve Eadha, Aidneach, which is now hidden behind that mountain all day long. He said to me: 'Olive, you are as lovely as the hills and the mountains on Slieve Fúaid,' he said, 'but my own kin are wiser than I;’","It was a beautiful evening when the sun set over the hills of Éirinn, and the fairies danced beneath the moonlight in the mountains of Oileann, where they had their dwelling. There was no one to hinder them, for it was not yet time for the night's darkness to fall, when the night would cover all three mountains in its shadow, so that the mountain of Éirinn and Aidne would be shrouded in darkness that night, as well as the mountain of Sléibh Fúaid; a great sorrow had fallen: 'Olc éimh atáthar agom anocht a haithle na caillighe & na ccenn ar Slíabh Fúaid,' he said, 'but I have no choice but to follow my own path, for it is not right for me to be in darkness;","They had crossed the river and were in the midst of a great battle when they came upon the head of Slieve Aughty, Aidneach, where it was found to be empty of human bodies, except for one, who was still wearing his clothes; he said, ‘O, I am weary of this night, and my feet are bleeding from walking on the stone road of Fúaid’s Hill,’ he said, ‘but I have been driven by my own conscience;’  then he spoke:","There is no peace in the world because of the evil that I have heard about from those who come to our hills, O Fionn, until one of them kills me and hides my head, so that they might be rid of the curse of this night, when there will not be another night like it, until the end of the world. When a great slaughter was done here by men in the past, before I knew anything about it, no one would have brought my father back to me alive, because he had been murdered by those who did not want me; but he said:‘O Fionn, the one that killed you last night was an outlaw and a man of evil deeds;’"
"They say that Suibhne in Loch an Uisce Dheagaidh for the sake of his beauty; he was always in a state of healthiness until he reached the glen of the white water, where he met the Gaible. The birds of the land were singing about him & as if it would be his fate to die that day .i. the crow with the red breast & the dark dove & the swan drinking from the Gabhlach, .i. the river from the name of the land, was caught in a net & thrown into the well by Suibhni in the time of that event ,i.e. the bird said:","They will be saved in the land of Suibne until the end of the world; and he was always in his sickness with a great longing for the green forest of Gaible. The soul of that man & his body would not be there for this coming year .i. the sea-cow, the deer, the wild boar, & the fish of the Gabhla, .i. the river of the forest, where he was taken by a great storm & buried in the deep; and it is said that the poet says:","The sea will be calm for you in the headland of Dathda; let it guard you from the waves' assault; and it will keep your life safe until this coming year. May the wind blow gently upon us & may we have peace, that there may be a prosperous year & a good harvest & a plentiful supply of fish, .i. the river of the forest, which has been a refuge for you in times past","He gave to Suibne in Lough Derg for a gift of a white horse; he stood fast in its strength through the misty and dismal Fardhglann forest until the spring of that year, which is said to be. The body of the man & the swan, the sea's dark water & the waves' loud roaring & the deer's swift running & the uisgean, i.e. the river of the forest's name, its shore a place of great mourning & the burial of the one Suibhni in that spring season until the end of the world & the saying of the poem is:"
"It was Suibhne who found the body of Eorann in a ditch near his house in the king's demesne, where he had been killed by a group of men. ‘Woe to you, Eorann,’ said Suibhne, ‘you have lost your soul.’ ‘Indeed,’ said Eorann, ‘and I am coming for you.’ ‘I will not be afraid,’ said Suibhne, ‘for the host of the assembly did not come to his aid in that place.’ ‘To me it seems,’ said the woman, ‘that no one has done anything for you & that we should not have been there, if only we had known about this wickedness, which was done by your own hand.’ ‘Alas, Suibhne, what sorrow will be yours after these words. When I think of the men who were with me, like Oill Cédach, king of Ua Fhaoláin, that it would have been good for us to see you;’ said she so","It was Suibhne who found the body of Eorann on the shore of a ford in his wife's house, where he had been killed by a blow to the head, and he said: ‘Woe. That is, O Eorann,’ he said, ‘I have slain you.’ ‘Indeed,’ said Eorann, ‘and I am coming for you,’ he said. ‘You will not escape me,’ said Suibhne, ‘for there was no one in the company of the man who killed him.’ ‘To my knowledge,’ said the woman, ‘no one has done harm to you & neither is it your fault that you have been wronged by them, for we do not know what they will do to us, and if we had known, we would not have seen that evil thing among our people. That is a great sorrow,’ said Suibhne, ‘and I am grieved at the loss of my wife after those words. When it was good fortune to me in my expectation of the man who was friendly to us, like one hundred cows & one hundred sheep, and on that day Oill Cédach, king of Ua fFhaoláin, was well pleased with what I had seen; he said so from above","Oh Suibhne, we have found Ireland on the right side of the ford in your father's house, with the king's women and the nobles, who said: ‘Well done. That is, my Ireland,’ he said, ‘I am a cowherd.’ ‘Indeed,’ said Ireland, ‘you are drawing near,’ he said. ‘You will not find it easy,’ said Suibhne, ‘for there was no host in the meeting of the cattle drive.’ ‘To me,’ said the woman, ‘no harm done to you and your people & neither did they come near us, lest we should have seen that same slaughter among our own people, which thou hast done to thyself.’ ‘Wretched is Suibhne’ said he, ‘for I am troubled on the side of women after those words. When it was good my intention towards the women who were friendly to me, as when I had one hundred cows and one hundred each, & on that day it was St. Cédach, king of Ua Fhaoláin, a good thing was seen by us;’ he said so from above","He met Suibhne outside her house by the ford of the king's road where his wife had thrown his body because he had killed him, saying: ‘Saddalp. This, O Ireland,’ said she, ‘is blood from my flesh.’ “As it is true,” said Ireland, “there are no people who will not hate you,” said she. “I did not do so of myself,” said Suibhne, “since the army of the enemy gathered near to cut off our alliance with you.” “For me,” said the woman, “you had better kill every creature that approaches you & not make peace with them except for those whom we have chosen for ourselves. We shall find this peace in our own flesh.’ ‘Truagh,’ said Suibhne, “this is an evil omen after the words of these men.

Asperd had not seen the end of war for many years and more than one battle. Aidchisi was his charioteer, who had driven the king's chariot in great battles.

"Cu Chulainn said to the people of Ulster, 'Let us not kill Cúchulainn of Ulster, for he is a great warrior. Let us spare his life, Conall and Láeg. We will not slay him because we believe in him. The sons of Lugh will be our allies and our friends on every occasion. Cu Chulainn took up the sword and slew the stag and brought back its head as a trophy.' 'I have taken the stag's head', said Ruad, 'and I will bring it myself to you.' 'Indeed', replied Cu Chulainn. 'Let us celebrate this victory in Ireland for a hundred years and make merry at our feast.'","Cu Chulainn said to the people of Ulster that he would avenge his father's death and kill all the Fomorians. He vowed to protect the king and his subjects from every danger. Conall and Lægairi were warned not to harm him, lest they incur the wrath of the gods. Cu Chulainn took up his spear and ran towards the enemy and said 'I will take my revenge on you', for Ruad, 'and I will make myself known among you'. 'Yes', replied Cu Chulaind. 'I will take a year's time to come to Ireland with an army and we will drive them out of it.'","Cu Chulainn said to the people of Dun Ad, 'and take the head of my father, that I may have a man to fight with.' Cu Chulainn took the spear from the people and said to them all, 'I will avenge Conolly & Lægairi. The lord of the Fomorians has killed me, but they do not know what my mother knows. I will take the king's chariot & ride in it before you.' Cu Chulainn took his spear again and rode into the fray & said 'Do-m-beur the people, Ruad', 'and I myself will get my revenge.' 'I will', said Cu Chulaind. 'Take a year of peace from this day on for Ireland until the end of time & may our messengers carry it.'","They came over the river and killed his father with a black spear in secret. They drove Cú Chulainn from Ulster, like all his relatives; they would slay him every day as a guest of Conchobor and Láegairi. He swore to avenge his father's death, though he did not believe it happened to them. Many wise men said there were three men on the battlefield who were certain the Fomorians had killed them, and they were not deceived about their mother. Cú Chulainn received as much meat as was in the cauldron & heard his mother's name clearly"
"It was Cú Chulainn who killed Aengus in Enna, and at the same time he slew Scélai in Annandale. If you had not come to Dunad Forcaill, I would have given Emiri my daughter as a gift. May many years pass over your head & may no evil befall you from the fury of the enemy. It is now, O Læig, that you will depart for the court of Ruaid, although it was not intended to happen, and yet it has come to pass. 'There is war', he says, 'the king's peace.'","It was Cú Chulainn who killed Aengus in Emain Macha and took his sword for himself. If he had not taken it, the king of Forcaill would have given it to Emir. The year is long past and no one remembers the great battle that occurred on that day. It will be a hundred years before another battle like this takes place, 'said he, 'the king's victory.'","Cu Chulaind was at Emain Macha with the women and they were given a feast to eat until dawn. And when he rose from his bed, Cu Chulaind went to Forcail to see Emir's wife. He spent many days at the palace & none of the people saw him leave the palace grounds. I will come again next year,' said he, 'for the king's hospitality.'","It was with Cúchulainn that I was bound in Ireland, and he broke the chain of our ancestors for me. For it is a hundred years since I left home to seek Emiri, the princess of Forcail. Many long months have passed since then & no one has seen or heard from my kin or any other outside the bounds of this forest. It will be a year and a half before I return,' he said, 'and they will find me in the king's bed"

The man who was carrying the stone, Cu Chulainn's companion, was not injured by the wound of the spear. The man ran quickly to the other side of the river, for he had a boat and was afraid of being caught. It was Derbforcaill ingen Rvaid & a h-inailt, 'You are evil in your heart, Cu Chulainn!' she said. 'I will not be silenced by your threats.' So Cu Chulaind threw the stone at her from behind a rock and hit her on the foot. 'I am not afraid of you,' said Cu Chulainn, 'for I have my spear. I will kill my servant, Lugaid Reondercc.' And he killed him","Cu Chulaind took the stone in his hand and threw it into the well, saying 'There is no shame in drinking from a well'. He said to Derbforcaill ingen Rvaid that he was not ashamed of being drunk, 'I would have been ashamed if I had not drunk', said Cu Chulaind, 'and my servant Lugaid Reondercc is at home. This is the truth","O holy Lord of the great fortresses on the plain of Loach Quan near Iarum, to your loyal men for so long a time on the sea"

I.e., three years and nine months from when it was said in the carpat serrgæ to Coin Culaind & this is because of the oath he made on iron ring-bands, but not on the silver rings of the Sardai, which are at his feet","The lord Cu Chulainn has been robbed by the servant of Forcaill and the daughter of the king is being led away before her father's marriage with Luglochtaib Logha to Forcaill & the lord Cu Chulainn had a fight against Luglochtaib Logha do dun Forgaill & indiltir in carbat serrgaie les-som in la s-sin & dobreth seul trom foair .i. torannclius trí cét & nonbair & ass e an tress laa ro h-indliodh  in carpat serrgæ do Coin Culaind      & iss airi asmperadh  ona serruib iarnaidib bidis i n-indiull ass, no ona Serdaib tucad  a bunadus ar tos","It was a fine day when Cu Chulainn rode out of Ulster to avenge Forcaill & to take the maiden of Feupus by force, whereas Cu Chulainn fought in Luglochtaib Logha's land for Forgaill & in the carbat serrgæ valley from Sin to Dobreth, namely: three hundred men & forty-five, because they were in that carpat serrgæ with Cu Chulainn & this is a great oath upon his spear in iron, so that on no day would Serdaib's tucad be in his presence, nor the sons of Ard Rí tos"
"Cu Chulaind said to me: 'I have not been able to find the three cauldrons of Lussa in the world, nor have I found the well of Bemenn, where it is said that the cauldron was hidden; but I will search for them until my death. For I am bound by oath to Con Culaind, and I will not rest until I find them. To Con Culaind I swear on my honor, on my kin, on my ancestors, and on the well of somnambulism that I will search for them until I have found them all; may God be with each of you. May Scannand forbes be upon you. For when Cu Chulaind died in the river, his body was thrown into Áth Scannand. He went to Glencar. Cu Chulaind died there for a long time. 'It is more bitter than the poison of the serpent', said Emer, 'the cauldron that was killed by my hand.' 'I have given the name of Glencar to the well of bitterness', replied Cu Chulaind","My lord of the Dunad Forcaill and I have come to the land of Tara with three lasses for marriage in one day and brought three beehives with them, which are full of honey, and we will take their cattle and horses as our own and the people of each village will give us what they can.

Eighteen men are with us. Bid Scenmend to come forth. My lord Cu Chulaind died in that place, where he was killed by Áth Scenmenn. We went to Glonnath. The death of Cu Chulaind is a great sorrow, said Emer 'the death of the king is a great calamity'. 'Bid Glonnáth his name be told among the people', said Cu Chulaind","At the top of Dunad Forcaill I stood and swore an oath that if I were not killed by the three of you in one battle I would give my head to the first of you, Scibar, and my sword to Ipur, and my armor to Cat, my three brothers Eimere. I swear on the bed of Con Culaind, who had taken refuge with me in the cave, that I will avenge him against those who killed him, and I will take back from them all his kin and property","At the entrance of Dunad Forcaill, I will be as gentle as a woman in childbirth to Con Culaind, who has lost his way and is in great pain, because he had killed my brother Scibar & Ipur & Cat, three brothers of Émer. Before going to kill Con Culaind in the house of Tuiret, the great fortification of Túr Gleann, we will take back our weapons from Érem's mother & daughter & all who were against him & we will go on to cause trouble.

"Cu Chulaind will be killed by Croofoit today, I swear it","Cu Chulaind will not be defeated by Crufóid. He has no name to stand against him, for the battles of this island are many and fierce in that place, where he dwells. 'Is there a king on that land today, Cu Chulaind!' said his mother and daughter. The Croofoit will tell you that it is so. To go to the fortress for the sake of Ath an Imfoit by the River. The Emiur has gone ahead. Cu Chulaind will take up position in the tower of that place, where he dwells with his companions and the rest of the army at the back. He will take up position on the right side of the army for the sake of their honor and the fame of those who have fallen there. The Croofoit will tell you that Ath an Imfoid is full of the bodies of those who fell there & all","Cu Chulaind will not be defeated in this battle, for he has the strength of a hundred men in his arms and the speed of a thousand horses over every plain.

Two men will be lost to the Ultaib, namely Bricne Nemtengai mac Carbad. The saying is: 'Bid doilig eim', he says, 'to Cú Chulainn's enemies today and tonight & the woman who touches his bed tonight, may she be killed in the feast of Concopar tonight, for it is less than the hatred of an Ultaib dogréss.' Now that Cú Chulainn has heard this, he will not cease to be angry with them and now he will take revenge on those who have wronged him by killing them in a trap set for them and they will go out dead","They will be eight times more numerous than the men of Ulster, when the host of Cúchulainn is at every pass of Ath Scannmenn for Ollambeo Boind m-Breg and are as good as the best of those who have fought against him, until they reach the island of Emuin and cross over to the other side. And it will be a great evil for the Ulaid that this man Cræbruaidh Concopuir is in command with the aid of the Emperor, and he will bring two hundred men from the Ulltai as hostages","Let the eight Cids of Ulster be marred by the slaughter of Cú Chulainn, that there may be no host in every pass of Ath Scannemnas for Ollambeo Boind m-Breg & comallustar with those who are not of the same blood as this sin, lest they incur the wrath of the gods and the curse of the ingeun & teid slan. May Emain Macha be spared from that destruction, in which is a great evil for Ulaid, and may they find protection against their enemies.

"Cu Chulainn will not be caught, he is swift as Sleip Niall","Cu Chulainn will not be caught, I swear to the horse Sleip Nair, that I will give you all my steeds and my chariots and my men, and I will drive each of them with a whip and my spear against your enemies in Sleip Nair, and I will bring back to you the head of your brother","Cu Chulainn will not leave until he reaches the land of Slep Fvaid, where he will have all the horses and cattle that are evil in the world","Cu Chulainn was about to leave, said Cathbad, 'Eight as the king has commanded against aid Bricne of Denam. May be Cu Chulainn safe', said he. 'Go for Cu Chulainn quickly!' cried Conchobar, 'because my brother is in great danger.' They hurried Cu Chulainn. 'He will not come' said he, '& you will lose evil fate against the horse of Sleip Nafnei.' You would hurry Cu Chulainn & neither-stay near him his steed & give all aid & every gift & deliver gacha fiadom folk to fear of that dark horse & neither-receive him into kinship with them by what is good faith of the people of Émain Macha. They would do many evil things for Cu Chulainn"
"They will be in Ulster for the winter, and it is known that: Emer was wedded to Concobar of the Uí Néill, and Fercus and Cathfad were her companions on this journey, who came with Con Culaind & brought Vlad into the land of the sidhe. They made this year & they will be in Ulster again. I have heard that Conchubor has taken Emirie to Ireland","Do you know the story of Ulster in the Táin? Is it true that Emer was with Concobar, Fercus and Cathbad at the feast when Cú Chulainn came home from Connaught and Vlad was killed on the plain by his spear","King of the Irish I am in Ulster, and my enemies are many: Emer was a great queen in the days of Concobar mac Nessa and Fercus and Cathfad, who were slain by Con Culaind & Vlad the Wolf and laid low in the land of the plain. This year they were slain & their bodies gathered. I have heard that Conchobor slew Emirie son of Irmaruch","Cosmic forces unite Ireland in the name of Ulltaib as the sacred fire is lit: Emer's victory over Concobar in battle, Fercus and Cathfad of Oinlepaid are freed from his grasp. It was then that Con Culaind and the women of the land awoke to Vlad's return, who had defeated Donn of the Land on its sacred site. The year is thus recorded & united as well.

"The three druids are not the three men of the city; the one is Falias, the other Goriah, the third Findias; and the fourth Murias. It was these four druids who were the three filid of the land before the coming of Tuatha Dé Danann with their wisdom","The three druids are not the three men of the city; the one is the son of Falias; the other is the son of Goriah; the third is the son of Findias; and the fourth is the son of Murias. It was these four druids who were the sons of the filid ocar, the wise men of the Tuatha Dé Danann","Those are the tribes of men who were left behind; The Falias tribe had but one man; The Gorias tribe had two men; The Findias tribe had three men; And the Murias tribe had four men. It was these, those four tribes of poets from the land of Túata Dé fios & éolas","The druids are not the kings, the kings are not the ones in Falias;  The shepherds of the plain, Eochaid have made a great victory; Uiscias the poet has made a great feat; Semias the wise man is in Murias. They were those druids of the bards who were learned in the lore and knowledge of Tuatha Dé Danann"
"The Lord of your people is in great need, for the sons of Ériu have been slain by the men of Feraib Bolc. The lord's banner was lowered before the fortress of Corcu Belgatan (i.e. Conmaicne Mara and his allies), with a part of their army on the plain","The Lord of your people is in the great battle of Ind-Set, against the sons of Ériu, to give them victory over the Ferae Bolc","God of the Tuatha Dé Danann in the great plain of Éirinn will give victory to those who are on the side of Feraib Bolc. The enemy's host was driven away by the Cetoir before the battle of Corcu Belgatan (that is, Conmaicne Mara and Uath-sen), with part of their army fleeing in panic. And the day and the sky were filled with the cries of the fallen and the air with the sound of their falling. It was thus that they took refuge in the place where no one could catch them","The Lord will defend you in the great battle of Ind-Sengi's sons against the Fir Bolg. The army of the Fir Bolg will be defeated before the fort of Corcu Bellatan, and they will have no refuge to flee to. As for your own house and family, you may rely on the protection of the Lord and heaven until the enemies are crushed and driven out of it"
"They say that the sea was calm as a mirror after the battle of Moytura and the kings' victory over the Tuatha Dé Danann, namely Ériu, daughter of Delbaíth; for it is said that the sea was full of calmness like a clear pool. And before this, when they had not yet made peace: we did not know how to make the waves cease; and the wind was strong in their faces","The sea was calm as the day of judgment and the lord's court had passed over Máoth Scéni, i.e., Éri ingen Delbaíth; for it is said that the sea has been full of waves like a great tumult","The woman was dead in the bed of the king's daughter Máoth Scéni .i. Éri ingen Delbaíth; for there is no sea so long as a shipwreck. And after that, when she had given birth to him: they did not know it until: there was no way out of her womb, and in her body was the child, a marvel, because she could not give birth again","They will not be saved from the sea's fury as long as the wall of combrede remains, until it falls and breaks like a rotten tree, for it is useless to try to repair it: there is no hope in this place"
"They are in the house of the lord, and I will go to the well of the lord's daughter. 'Where is this?' he says to them. 'It is there,' she replies. 'I have seen the men of the quarter.' 'The men of Tuath Dé Danann are with me in my household & my wife as if they were our own kin","They will be there before the sun rises in the east. 'Where is this?' he asked them. 'It's over by the well of the great host,' they replied. 'We have seen it from our window, and we know that they are coming to the assembly place. The men of Tuath(a) Dé are with me, and my wife says that they will be here before I finish this letter","They killed them in secret. The wife found it by the fire of the hearth, where the man had been slaughtered. 'Where is this?' he said to himself. 'I have eaten my children,' she said. 'Break fast with me at the common hall. I am the mother of Tuatha Dé Danann from my womb and my breast like a woman who has given birth","The mother is better, the children are worse at this time of year"
"He is the son of Etain and Aengus, king of Fomor. Berchán son of Diarmait was his foster-father, but he had no other name than Eochaidh Bres (from Eochaidh Cruthach), for every shape or form that touched him in Ireland — earth and hill and cave and coin and bed and iron and wood—is rising up to be his son, until there is none left 'to be taken by' Bres there","He is the son of Etain and Aengus, king of Fomor. Berchán son of Diarmait, with no other name but Eochaidh Bres (from Eochaidh Cruthach), who was every creature in Ireland —man and woman and child and cow and horse and ox—is rising again to take the place of Bres there","He is the son of Étain and the husband of Eocha Bres, for all the sidhe in Ireland – each one a king or a chieftain or a lord or a woman or a man – are risen up against him because he killed Bres there","He is in great haste and says that Elothae son of Delpaith king of Fomor has arrived. Berach son of his nurse is crying, & no one knows his name but Echo Bres (from the ancient Echo Cruthach), at every creature on this island —each man, woman, child, and beast—is rising, and he is coming for him who had 'taken' Bres there"
"The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise as he said long ago to our fathers, 'That we should wait for Christ to rise from the dead.' Now he has made this very clear to us by raising him from the dead and giving him glory, so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow - in heaven and on earth and under the earth. And every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. And over all power and authority in heaven and on earth and under the earth, now and forever. Amen","The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise; as is our Lord Jesus Christ, so also will he be with us forever. For the Lord helps those who are taken up to heaven (i.e. the mother) from the snares of the wicked. The Lord's mother was a holy woman, and she dwelt in that holy place, i.e. Dun Brese. And it is said that the Dagda had his dogs there","The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise; as is our Lord's will to save you, and to give you the kingdom which he promised you: whereof he saved us by the power of his name, and delivered us from darkness, and brought us into light, and made it so bright before your eyes. And that which is the father of all things began in heaven; but now at last he has come down here also, namely to Dun Brese. For this is the house of God, and the gate of heaven","The land is full of the enemy until Túath Déu; the sovereignty of Ireland is with her son; and thus a great multitude of the enemies are transferred from Erin (i.e. the mother) into his territory, for that which is not pleasing to the people of his house has been taken away. It is told that the mother of the land is thus, & their king has died since then, namely Dun Brese; and it was the Dagda's dog who was killed in his stead"
"The lord of the dogs is at work, and he has taken the dog's food into his house, Cridenbél by name, who has eaten a whole side of meat as a reward for his service. He gave to Crichinphél his best servant and gave more to the Dagdae. As he said, 'O Dagdae, do not take three million beasts from my own territory!' He was praised above all the other dogs. Many of those who were in mourning because they had lost a dog will be happy again. It is three years since I have been without a dog. The lord of the dogs has given us three more dogs than we had before. Meat will be served at the Dagdhae's dinner party","The lord of the dogs is at work, and he has taken his seat in the house, Cridenbél by name, who will be killed as a sacrifice to the brand, but more than that, the Lord Crichinphél has taken his place & more than that, the Dagdae. As it was said, 'The Dagdae, do not take three millions of beasts to kill in my stead!' He brought them before the Dagdae every night. More than that, a million of his cattle were killed. Three times more than that, the Dagdhua took three millions of cattle. May the blessings of the Dagdhae be upon you","It was a dark night when the Dagda occurred, & he took his spear into work, & caught the two birds in his house, Cridenbél's name, because it was said that he had killed one of her sons as a punishment for his bruding. But it was Crichinphél who had his fessin & but not all the Dagda. As he understood, 'The Dagda, where are the three million spears I gave to you!' He brought him every night above the Dagda's head. Many more than three were said to be in the Dagdhua's store. May the blossoms of the Dagdhae be upon your table","The dog ate my dinner, and it's still in the kitchen, Cridenbél is its name, because it has eaten all of my supper as a boy"
"They killed the Dagda with a black club in the midst of his hundred-headed cattle, 'Well done,' said Mac Óc. 'Amen,' replied Dagda. 'How did you do it?' asked he. 'I struck him on the neck,' replied Mac Óc. 'We have been waiting for three years to get rid of him and now we will be free,' said Mac Óc",It is good that the Dagdai has come to my house with his wife and son,"It was good that the Dagdai had come to see Mac n-Óc, and they said: 'Well done, Dagdai,' or in Mac Óc. 'Amen,' said the Dagdae. 'How did you travel so far?' he asked. 'We have been journeying for three years,' replied he","Thank you very much, Dagdai,' replied Macóc. 'Yes' said the Dagdae. 'I am not in a good mood,' said he. 'Your wife has been unkind to me,' replied Macóc. 'We have been waiting for three months without seeing your daughter and I couldn't bear it.'"
"They say that Robháoi-siumh amlaidh sin at the Glen of Bolcáin went to seek him out in Clúain Cilli because of Thíre Chonaill & Thíre Bóghaine. They came upon a sraith of the poets who had been there before, for they had lived and drunk there on that night. The poet's body was found in the well. It is said that it was the most beautiful woman in that well, that family of Brughaigh mic Deaghaidh would know her and that she had a great sorrow in that night when Suibhne went to the well so much that he became mad from the sight of her; and the poem says: ‘Woe is me,’ he said, ‘for I have seen that noble woman who was hard to find’","They say that Robháoi-siumh amlaidh sin at the Glen of Bolcáin went to seek him out in Clúain Cilli because they had heard that Thíre Chonaill & Thíre Bóghaine were there, and it rained heavily on them as they journeyed through the land which was full of bogs and water that night. They arrived at their destination, but it was a very cold place in that cellar. It is said that Fáibhlen do muintir Brughaigh mic Deaghaidh were there, and there was a great deal of suffering that night when Suibhne went to the well; he said: ‘Woe be upon him,’ he said, ‘that has not heard of Muigh Rath’s great misfortune in that difficult place’; and it is sung in that song above thus:","They say that the spirit of the well at Glencullen was stirred up one night, when Cluan Cilli and Thire Bóghaine came to it to call on Tirerchan of Connaught & Tirerchan of Bóghain. The water rushed out in a torrent, as if there were blood & water in that night; the well broke open. It was said that the noble family of Brughaigh of Deaghaidh would be ruined in that place, and a great calamity occurred on that night when Suibne went to it, & he said: 'Alas,' he said, 'that I have been to Muigh Rath for a bad omen is in this well too'; the poem was sung from above so that:","The man from Glendalough went to the fair in Clonmacnoise to see Theobald & Theobald of Ballybofey. He encountered great danger on his way as there was a huge beast in that night. I came with my little sheep. It is clear that it was of the family of Brughach mac Diaghaidh, and there were big mournings among them that night when they heard that Suibne had come to a great end that evening, & he said: “Trouble always,” he says, “never finds me so easy as in this place is difficult to be escaped;” the poem went thus above:"
"They say Suibhne was buried before the time of the chill on Snamh da Én for Sionainn, in the boundary of Cluain Boirenn that day; they said that he had been killed by the fairies there. As he was being buried, the priests of the church were calling out the nonon, men and women at the town, with their hands on their breasts. 'I am not a coward,' says Suibhne, 'of my wife's daughter in Choimdedh, she is the one who has taken my head,' he says, 'as it was done to my brother-in-law in the battle of Maigh Rath.' They say that Suibhne's cloak was wrapped around his body, and they said: 'He was a coward,' says he, 'the voice of the women on the breast of Banna for every place is grig-gráig the sound of the clout this evening,' and thus he sang","They say Suibhne was buried before the time of the chill on Snamh da Én for Sionainn, in the boundary of Cluain Boirenn at that time; they said that he had been killed by a woman with a spear in his back then. As he was being buried, the priests of the church were saying the prayer and men were standing around him with their hands on their breasts. 'I am not hungry,' says Suibhne, 'for my wife's milk at Choimdedh for my children.' 'The breast of the cow is full,' says he, 'so that it would be a good omen for my brother in the battle of Maigh Rath.' They say that his leg was buried with an esparta cloth, and thus he said: 'I am hungry,' says he, 'the voice of the cows on the breast of Banna for every people is grudging the sound of the clout this night,' and thus he sang a song","They say Suibne was killed before his time, on a hill by the stream of Snamh Dha Én in Sionainn, where the boundary of Cluain Boirenn is; they say that he was slain by the women, and that it happened at night when his mother came to visit him. 'I am not hungry,' says Suibne, 'for the wife of my lord, the Choimdedh. The woman took her time to come over the hill,' says he, 'and as she did so I heard a sound like a dog barking on the brow of Banna for each leith in turn, grumbling and whining the whole night,' singing:","There once lived a spirit woman named Suibhne before her death at the bottom of Cluain Boirenn in County Sligo, who brought sickness to man by snoring loudly. When she was dying, her male kin gathered around her at church and in town, with men at the gate and women at the breast, saying 'There is no need for mourners,' said Suibhne, 'to my daughter at the Choimdedh house of our people. The fair-haired man of the Ben an Lión', she said, 'as if it were a general procession to Cath Maigh Rath.' As he lay on his spartan bed that night, the spirit consoled him: 'I am not in pain,' said the woman, 'to my son-in-law on the mountain pass at every turn where I see your grey-haired wife', singing thus:"
