"A great battle was fought for Ulster at the Slieve Foy, and there were many deaths and a great assembly, namely, between Conall and Coincullan and Loegaire. 'I will strike you,' said Conall, 'the head of Messgegra who was slain before us in that assembly, each one of whom had placed a price on the heads of young warriors, and they had given them weapons and shields, and they had made them wear red cloaks over their shoulders.' And then there were notices put up in the assemblies or in the meetings which were given to them so that they would not strike with their hands","A great battle was fought for Ulster by the men of Sliab Fúait. They made a great slaughter and a rout, namely, between Conall and Coincualaind and Lóegaire. 'I will strike you,' said Conall, 'the head of Messgegra who was slain before them in the battle.' It was the custom of the Ulstermen in that assembly that each man gave a portion of his own wealth to the men of the household, and they would give them a share of their cattle and goods, so that they might make a red (i.e., bloody) slaughter upon them.

"Well done, Conall,' said Conchobor, 'you have not failed to take the news of the battle from the wounded, you have not failed to bring word from them.' 'It is true,' said Conall","Good, Conall,' said Conchobor, 'either you have not heard of the news or you are not aware of the matter; you are not speaking truly.' 'It is true,' said Conall","Well done, Conall,' said Conchobur, 'you have not failed to give your advice on the matter of the information concerning the galloping horses, you have given good advice from the beginning.' 'It is true,' said Conall","Well done, Conall,' said Congobor, 'you have not neglected the inquiry into the matter of the information [given] to the men, you have not failed in your inquiry here.'

"They were driven back from the ford before they could reach the hill of the king. Each of them went to his own house, and he was not seen again.

It was said that he had the strength of the Fúait and three hundred men with him against the Ulaid","They brought her afterwards from the east to the west where she was born. They carried each of her two arms upon a shield. They gave to Cet, son of Matach, a chariot and a company to Ulster. The beast was in the north of Samhred in Cét. It was given to him by the king of the Fomorians with three hundred warriors along with his Ulstermen",They were brought back from the west by force before they had reached the degree of wisdom. They went each to their own dwelling place with a great crowd. They were led by Cet mac Matach to the territory beyond Ulto. The beast was in the land of Hérinn called Cet. It was driven away from the sight of the Fúait and three hundred men with him towards the Ultaib,"She was carried after that by the foreigners before her body was buried.

'The king of the Ulaid has not given me a share of his people.' 'Not so,' said Cend Berraide, to his servant.

"They were fighting together with their men against Conall, that is Fingen. It was the first time they had ever fought for the day or for the night in line without breaking from the galloping there, and they would not break from it again. 'Good,' said Fingen, 'the god of war will strike you from your head so that you may be killed by the spear. If you are not struck now, you will not find peace nor will you have anything else.' 'It is a strong fortress,' said Ulaid, 'that which you call your own.'","They brought him to where the Lia Fáil was with Conall, that is, Fingen.

Afterwards, a meeting was held with Óengus Huí Máil, and it was agreed that his meeting should be held first. It is said that Huí Máil had three hundred men under him; but Óengus had only three noble men from them.

"The king of the men of Máel will not be able to do so. The son of Óengus took his wife. She went to the place where her husband was, and she found her mother-in-law in the glen.

"It is true from the Tiagait that they were not immune to new weapons. Congairet said fair. 'Innafhail tall, O Engus?' 'Cosmail my life,' said Oengus, 'and not to kill for six. We will take their heads.' 'My head, indeed,' said the woman. With a sudden blow I struck the head of the woman and gave her a wound in the side and a spear thrust through the body.

'It was food that I had,' said she, 'in this house. My daughter and for the girl herself were slain.' And then they found a cow in the field on that day. Then Oengus and Aithechda made a truce between them","It is true from the Tiagait that when they were immune to new poisons. Congairet said fairly. 'Innafhail tall, O Engus?' 'Cosmail my life,' said Oengus, 'and not to kill for six. No one will be killed by them.' 'My son,' said the old man.

My daughter and the girl herself were slain.' And thus they found the corpse on that day when they were there. Then afterwards Oengus and Aithechda made a pact between them"

"It was there that Óengus was killed by the men of Aithechdai, and it was for his own men that he was slain. (It was not Dubchrón who killed Óengus at that time.) Then a man from the east came to him with a grey spear, and struck him in the eye and in the face, and the people of Aithechda were gathered around him (i.e., in the house of Óengus) until three men came to slay him. They cut off his head, and they took his red hair and his mantle from his head. Dubchrón was taken for Dubglais, i.e., for his own taking. 'Treason, O Dubchrón,' said he. 'Not so,' said Dubchrón. 'What of Óengus?' 'He is in the cotlud; sit, sit, and do not be afraid. Treason and treachery in this house.' 'I will not take his cotlud unless it be given to me by right. Take the mantle from him,' said he. He took it. 'Truth, O Óengus,' said he.

Then he cut off his head, and it was given to him for his redness and for his mantle over his head. Dubchrón took up the spear, .i. his own spear. 'Fighting, O Dubchrón,' said he. 'Not so,' said Dubchrón. 'What of Óengus?' 'He is in the cotlud; sit, sit, on what you do not know. Fighting and fighting this house.' 'I will not strike him unless it be with a blow from the air. Take the mantle from his face,' said he. He took it. 'Truth, O Óengus,' said he. And he said: 'Deithbir to him who strikes, whatever is white in the condition of the face; imma·rulaid ilar lám in cenn fil for Óengus","There was, however, a man named Oengus who was of the tribe of Aithechdai, and he was killed by men from his own side. (It was not Dubcrón the servant of Oengus at that time.) Then a man from the east came to them with grey hair, old eyes, and old hands, and he brought the clan of Athechda to the place where they would be slain (.i. to the place of Oengus), so that three men were killed in one night. They afterwards cut off his head, and they took his red hair and his mantle from his head. Dubcrón was then struck by Dubglais .i. by his own hand. 'Flee, Dubcrón,' said he. 'Not I,' said Dubcrón. 'Where is Oengus?' 'He is in the cotlud; sit, sit, on what you do not know. Flee and flee to that house.' 'I will not flee from him unless he be a friend. Take the mantle from his body,' said he. He took it. 'True, Oengus,' said he.

'Not at all,' said Dubchrón. 'What is Óengus?' 'He is in the fortress; sit, sit, on that which does not disturb you. Throwing and throwing this thing.' 'I will not throw his fortress unless it be with a man who would carry it off. Take the garment from him,' said he. He took it. 'Truth, Óengus,' said he.
