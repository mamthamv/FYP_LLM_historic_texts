"It is said that a certain tale was told of Suibhne, and Moling greatly delighted in it as if it were one fable, and the stone was thrown at every man who had heard the tale of Suibhne. 'Indeed, this is a tale of a man,' said Moling, 'we would have been safe from the madness of the company of such a man. It was pleasant for me to see Suibhne, that is, this very tale concerning that tioprait beyond, that is, Tiupra the tioprat§na Gealta by name, because it is certain that not only the god who is worshipped and the gods who are worshipped and the good things which belong to them are the ones who appoint the tioprait. Indeed, every other kind of madness or unreasonableness concerning Suibhne'; then Moling added","It is said that there was a contest of wit between Suibhne and Moling, and Moling was greatly pleased with the cleverness of Suibhne as if it were a single jest, and he called him a stone to every man in the teaching of Suibhne. 'Indeed, this is a jest,' said Moling, 'we would have been safe from the disturbance of the company of such a man. It was pleasant for me to see Suibhne, that is, this jest itself, on that particular topic, namely, the Tioprat, whose name is Gealta, because it is indeed notable how many things are said and done by God and by the saints and by the holy ones who are appointed over the Tioprat. Indeed, every other kind of jest or tale is not as good as Suibhne's'; thus spoke Moling","It is said that a certain tale was told of Suibhne, and Moling greatly delighted in it, as if it were one story, and they called it the stone of every man who heard the tale of Suibhne. 'Indeed, this is the tale of the man,' said Moling, 'we have been accustomed to be safe from the conversation concerning the madness of this man. It was pleasant for me to see Suibhne, that is, this tale is about that tioprait (a type of demon or spirit) beyond, that is, Tiupra the tioprat§na, whose name is Gealta, because it is known that not only a god is said to be born from him and a goddess but also the chief of the tioprats. Indeed, every other tale is not comparable to Suibhne'; then Moling concluded","It is said that a satire was composed against Suibhne, and Moling greatly rejoiced at this, for he had long desired to compose a satire against him as well, and he called upon every man to listen to the satire of Suibhne. 'This is indeed a good satire,' said Moling, 'for we have long been in harmony concerning the matter of the poet who is the subject of this satire. It was pleasant for me to see Suibhne, that is, this satire against him, at the recitation of that particular poem called Tiupra tioprat§na Gealta, for it is indeed a notable composition, and the god who is praised, and the god who is known, and the god who is worshipped, are all in the mind of the poet. Indeed, I know every other kind of satire, but not this one by Suibhne'; thus spoke Moling"
"The youth said that he had been struck. 'Because of the deed of vengeance, O youth,' said Suibhne, 'that is my marring without any delay, for I will not allow a feast to be held under the shadow of your slain son's spear.' 'If you wish to have peace in this place,' said the youth, 'you would not know it even if it were great to me, the hidden things.' 'By Christ, O man,' he said, 'I do not take your hidden thing from any one who has a hidden thing in his mind, as God gave me a small portion of your life here and took a small portion of your milk from the woman's breast, and I would not allow the side of the woman to be against her own kind on the earth of the slain.' 'May Christ protect you, O youth,' said Moling, 'because of the evil deed of vengeance, a great sorrow is upon you and a separation from the deed of vengeance.' 'There is no strength in your words,' said Suibhne, 'for they are like the cold wind from the west and I will be slain for the marring of the form.' 'May the law protect you there,' said Moling, 'that is, my protection from harm to you,' and they made a truce between them threefold: namely, Suibhne, Mongán and Moling","The youth said that he had been wounded. 'Because of the deed of revenge, O youth,' said Suibhne, 'that is my maiming without mercy, for I will not allow a feast to be held under the shadow of your father's slain son.' 'If you wish to go forth and be noble,' said the youth, 'you would not have been able to do so even if it were great to me to be a warrior.' 'By Christ, O man,' he said, 'I did not allow my own maiming to be equal to that of any other man's maiming on my body. From the will of God I was made and you would have been given a small portion of my life here, & you would have taken a small portion from God for your own sake from the women who were slain, et I did not allow the side of the women to be against their own kind on the earth of the slain.' 'May Christ protect you, O youth,' said Moling, 'because of the evil deed of revenge, a grievous wound upon you and a great injury beyond the deed of revenge.' 'There is no strength in your words, O Suibhne,' said he, 'for they are like the burrs of the thistle and will be like death to me for the maiming of my body.' 'A claim of justice against you,' said Moling, 'that is a mutual agreement between us for your benefit,' & they made a truce between them threefold: namely Suibhne, Mongán & Moling","The youth said that he had been wounded. 'Because of the deed of revenge, O youth,' said Suibhne, 'that is my maiming without any delay, for I will not allow a feast to be held under the shadow of the axe of the sharpened sword.' 'If you wish to have peace in your life,' said the youth, 'you would not know it even if it were great to me, a hidden thing.' 'By Christ, O man,' he said, 'I do not allow your hiddenness to be on any part of my body where another man's hiddenness is on the ridge of my skin. From the will of God I have been made and you would be given small mercy for my life here and small grace from God for you from the women of the world, and I do not think that the side of the women will be with you in your need on the land of the unfruitful.' 'May Christ protect you, O youth,' said Moling, 'because of the evil deed of revenge, a grievous wound to you here and a punishment for the deed of revenge.' 'There is no strength in your speech,' said Suibhne, 'for they will be raised up against me from the east and I will be slain for the maiming of the form.' 'A legal judgment upon you there,' said Moling, 'that is, a mutual agreement between us for your benefit,' and they set a law upon her in threefold, that is, Suibhne, Mongán and Moling","The boy said that the devil had whispered to him. 'That is the act of revenge, O boy,' said Suibhne, 'that is my marring-sa without mercy, for I would not allow a feast of hospitality under the shadow of the death of your father's sons.' 'If you are determined to do so,' said the boy, 'you will not be able to go through it even if it were great for me to take on such an undertaking.' 'By Christ, O man,' he said, 'I would not allow your marring-sa to be compared to any other man's marring, as I have heard of others' marrings on the back of my own land. From God's grace I was made and you were given a small part of my life here, and you received a little from God for me from the women who were in mourning, but they would not accept it on behalf of the women on the lands of those who were slain.' 'May Christ protect you, O boy,' said Moling, 'it is an evil act of revenge; a deadly blow to you abiding and a wound behind the act of revenge.' 'There is no strength in your words, O Suibhne,' said Suibhne, 'for they are heated up with fire and would be placed upon my body for the destruction of the form.' 'I have pity on you there,' said Moling, 'that is a shared mercy from me to you,' and they set upon him, the three of them: Suibhne, Mongán and Moling"
"There was a battle of Suibhne against the men of Connacht, and it happened under the moonlight on the night of All Fairs in the land of Múaidhe; a glen of alpine heather, a stream of alpine water, a scribbled writing by the scribe, and a tinny bell ringing all alone; above and below there were the old men and the young men, and they were together in their assembly of holy and truthful men, and it was so that they were together. A branch of the fragrant tree was broken off from its roots, and it was in that place where the people had been assembled and the women and the great cattle; it was so that a red-hued salmon was caught in the river after coming from the great sea into that place. Suibhne's house was burned down greatly by that fire, and he took refuge for protection and gave his testimony before the assembly; and thus spoke the poet","There was a battle of Suibhne against the men of Connacht, and it happened under the moonlight on the night of All Fharannáin in the territory of Múaidhe; a glen of alpine heather, a stream of alpine water, a scribbled writing by the scribe, and a tinny bell ringing all alone; above and below there were holy men and truthful people together in their assembly, and it was good that they were. There was a tree of sheltering branches with fruits of great abundance in that place. It was good that there was a true harvest and a fertile field at the bending of the land where great crops would be reaped; it was as if the noble nobility had been born in that place, with its hills and valleys and large cattle. It was good that there were many generous gifts given there after coming from the great sea into that place. Suibhne's house was destroyed by that great calamity, so he took refuge and gave his testimony before the assembly; thus spoke the poet","There was a battle of Suibhne against the men of Connacht in the time of the high kings, and it happened under the reign of King Fharannáin of the land of Múaidhe; a valley of the plain, a stream of the plain, a hill of the plain, and a lake of the plain, and there were many noble and faithful men assembled together in that place. It was the same place where the branches of the sacred tree were broken by the violent destruction which happened in that place. It was the same place where the true fruit and the good seed were crushed by the crookedness of those who had great power, it was the same place where the noble and wise men were slain after coming from a great sea to that place. Suibhne's house was destroyed greatly by that calamity, so he chose to be accepted and gave his submission to the high king; thus spoke the poet","It was on the day of Suibhne, when he was hunting in Connacht for a goodly hound, that it happened under the sky of heaven that he came upon a deer in the territory of Farannán, of Tír Fhiachrach Múaidhe; a glen of sloping hills and a stream of sloping valleys, where there were many salmon and plenty of fish, and indeed it was good and fertile there. The trees were fruitful with branches producing great abundance of fruit in that land. It was good also the breed of the deer which were true in their nature and had bright eyes; they bent their heads to the ground so that their horns might strike the earth, and it was as though nobles and knights were present in that glen, along with hounds and wild boars of great strength. It was good also that there were many red roebucks which were hunted there after coming from a great sea into that land. Suibhne's house was built in that place, so that he might dwell there in peace and give his protection to the people; thus spoke the poet"
"Suibhne was in the house of the bishop of the town of Moling, that is, the house of Moling. It was then that the psalter of Caoimhin was in the possession of the people of the accepted ones. Later Suibhne was in the row of the tropes in the place of the clerics and took a portion of the bread. 'Because of this early plunder, you wicked men,' said the cleric; then they went to Moling and drove Suibhne out from it","Suibhne was in the house of the bishop of the town of Moling, that is, the house of Moling.

'Because of this early plunder, you wicked men,' said the cleric; then they went to Moling and drove Suibhne out from it","Suibhne was speaking to me under the shade of the yew tree in the town where Moling was, that is, the house of Moling. It was then that the psalm of Caoimhin was being sung in the assembly of Moling for the benefit of the people of the household. Later Suibhne spoke to the row of the poets in the assembly of the clerics and asked them to eat bread. 'Because of this early battle, my boys,' said the cleric; then he went to advertise Moling and rebuked Suibhne for it","Suibhne spoke to me beneath the roof of the house of the king of the town of Moling, that is, Teach Moling. It was then that the psalm of Caomhghin was in the recitation of Moling, giving praise to the people of the chieftain. Afterwards Suibhne spoke to the row of the servants in the service of the chieftain and took a portion of food. 'This is a great victory, O men,' said the chieftain; then he gave Moling an offering and Suibhne rejected it"
"“It is not your custom to be here, O Suibhne,” said Moling, “nor your habit to be here and your seeking of the hunt, your stories and your wandering for the purpose of finding a place of truth and of the gathering in the church of the faithful, and you are not fit for it,” said Moling, “although every day I have been going through all Ireland to gather every kind of sport for you to enjoy.”","“It is not your custom to be here, Sir Suibhne,” said Moling, “nor for you to have come here and to have sought the tale and the story of their finding and their plunder in the true religion, and they are not found there,” said Moling, “although every day I go to every part of Ireland seeking every kind of sport until I find a tale worth listening to.”","“It is not easy for you to find a place, O Suibhne,” said Moling, “for the one who has given you your dwelling and your livelihood for the pursuit of stories and journeys, who has sought and found truth and sincerity in the religion of faith, and who has granted you safety and shelter,” said Moling, “though great is the strife that each day in Ireland brings upon me from every side until I am overcome by the burden of stories.”","“It is a fine deed you have done, O Suibhne,” said Moling, “which is the song that should be sung of your being here and your struggle for the deed here, your search and pursuit of the noble reward and the true recompense in the field of truth, and this is the fruit of it,” said Moling, “although every day I have seen from Ireland the destruction of all the heathen who come to me to be converted by my story.”"
"The slaughter of the cattle afterwards; it was in that year that Moling was making a pilgrimage. He passed a day at Inis Bó Finni in the western part of Connacht, a day at Ess Rochara of Rúaidh, a day at Slíabh Mínáluinn Mis, a day at Benda Biothfhúara Boirche; and from those places he went every day without ceasing to his house at Moling. Moling ordered that a portion of the best of it should be given him, and he gave in return a cow's milk for the milk of the cows which were given to him. The name of the cow was Muirghil; she was the daughter of Mungan who had been the milker of Moling. It was this cow that gave the milk of that portion, i.e., the milk of the udder of a cow which was in the enclosure at the house of Moling, and it was full of leanness for Suibhne. He took from it a full measure of the richest milk for the nourishment of his body","The death of the woman afterwards; it was in that year that Moling was making a pilgrimage. He passed a day at Inis Bó Finni in the western part of Connacht, a day at Ess Rochara of Rúaidh, a day at Slíabh Mínáluinn Mis, a day at Benda Biothfhúara Boirche; and from those places he went every day without ceasing to his house at Moling. Moling ordered that a certain portion be given to him for that time, and he gave in return the milk of a cow which had not been given to him before. The name of the woman was Muirghil, who was the daughter of Mungan, the wife of Moling. It was she who made the portion of food which was given to the woman, namely, a dish of cooked meat with its broth in the cooking pot and all the fat from it for Suibhne. He gave her also a full measure of honeyed mead. Then he went forth to meet the man who had stolen that milk","The death of the girl afterwards; it was in that year that Moling was fasting. He passed a day of penance at Inis Bó Finni in the western part of Connacht, a day of penance at Ess Rócháoin Rúaidh, a day of penance at Slíabh Mínáluinn Mis, a day of penance to Benda Biothfhúara Boirche; and from all those places he went every day of his penance until the evening in Moling's house. Moling ordered that a special meal be prepared for him on that day, and he gave an order regarding the woman's cow that was not given to him. The name of the woman was Muirghil; she was the wife of Mungán who had been the foster-father of Moling. It was the portion of that meal which was given to the woman, namely, a single loaf of bread with a piece of cheese in it, and all the rest of the food there was given to Suibhne. He gave her some of the milk from the cow's udder until she had enough for her needs and also filled her full of milk","The wounding of the girl afterwards; it was in that year that Moling was fasting. He went on a journey to Inis Bó Finni in the west of Connacht, on a journey to Ess Rochairn Rúaidh, on a journey to Slíabh Mínáluinn Mis, on a journey to Benda Biothfhúara Boirche; from each of these places he returned every day with his staff and spent each night in the house of Moling. Moling ordered a portion of food for himself that very evening, and he prepared a meal of milk and meat to be given him by the woman who was giving birth. The name of that woman was Muirghil; she was the wife of Mungan, the mother of Moling's child. It was this portion of food that was given to the woman, namely, the food of a pig's shoulder with its skin and the whole of the pork there in it for Suibhne. He took from it a sufficient quantity for a meal in the middle of the feast of the milk of that cow"
"A vision of the fairies appeared to the poet Muirghil and the women of the household in the dwelling, and she said to another woman: 'I have a message for you,' said she, 'that no other man will be your husband, nor will your own man ever be able to satisfy you in the love that is so great in you.' Then she turned from that vision and although she did not tell anything else, Muirghil went at dawn to the place where the milk was being drawn to Suibhne of the fair household who was as comely as the flower. From the side of that vision came a voice saying to her brother: 'Your daughter is in that flower, O noble man,' said she. The young man heard that and went forth with great sorrow and took his hand from the half-moon which had been placed before him and went forth to the place of the fairies. Soon after, the fairy and her companion came towards him and he was in the woods throwing away his portion of food and drink. Then the youth cast a spear at the half-moon in his hand, which broke his left arm, and he fell to the ground. The assembly of the hill of the hounds surrounded the youth, where his death would be, and they brought him to the place where the fairies had been, and there he died","A vision of an old man appeared to the poet Muirghil and the women of the household in the hall, and he said to another woman: 'I have a message for you,' she said, 'that no other man will be your husband, nor will your own husband ever be able to satisfy you in the love that is so great within you.' Then she turned her back on that hall and went, although she did not tell anyone or say anything about Muirghil going at dawn to the place of the cow to Suibhne the generous, who was as kind as a father. From the hall came a woman, and she said to her sister: 'Your daughter is in that love, giving herself to a man, O my noble lady,' she said. The young man heard this, and he became very sad and sorrowful, and took his half-length sword from inside the house and went out to meet the girl. Soon after, the girl came with her side towards him and he was in the middle of the hall. The young man threw the half-sword from his hand, which cut off his foot at the ankle against Suibhne, giving him the opportunity to run through his leg. Then the assembly cried out that a hill of the head of the hound had struck the young man down, where he would have fallen from the hall, so that we might know that he died soon after","A vision of the fairies of Mhuirghil and the women of the mound appeared to him in the night, and she said to the other woman: 'I have a message for you,' said she, 'that no man else shall be your husband, nor shall any man else be your lover, but that your own husband shall be your ruler in the kingdom which is prepared for you this year.' Then she turned from that mound, and although she did not tell anything further, Muirghil went at dawn to the place where the milk was carried to Suibhne of the fair mounds who was as dear to the people as the sun. From the side of that mound came a voice from within, and it said to her brother: 'Your wife is in that kingdom with a man of the world, O noble youth,' said she. The young man heard this, and he wept bitterly and cast his arms into the air and went forth to the place where the fairies were. Afterward came the fairy woman and her companion, and they were playing at the edge of the lake and casting their portions from it into the water. Then the young man threw a stone at the half-moon in her hand, which broke her foot on the left side against Suibhne, and she was able to pass through by breaking her leg there. The people of the hill then came together, saying that the noble youth had been killed in the place where the fairies were, so that we have heard from them, that they found death","A storm arose in the east, and the men of Murrough and women of the district were in the battlefield, and a woman said to another: 'You are as dear to me,' she said, 'as any other man, but not more so than your own man who is righting the wrongs that have been done to you this year.' Then she turned from the battlefield, and although she did not say anything else, Murrough went at dawn to the place where the cow was being driven to Suibhne of the noble district, which was as good for the milk as any. From the side of the battlefield she came back and said to her sister: 'The woman in that wrong is giving a man of the district, my dear kinswoman,' she said. The boy heard this, and immediately went on foot with his hand on the hilt of his sword and went forth towards the enemy. Soon afterwards, the enemy and their side came at him, and he was in flight from them, being in the middle of the fight. The boy struck a blow to the half of the shield in his hand, which broke his left arm against Suibhne, and he took the opportunity to pass through the gap in the shield. Then came the assembly of the men of the hill, who surrounded the boy from all sides, where he had been wounded by the enemy, so that we thought he would die"
"He was born of two parents in that place, and he was brought up in the land to give a portion to his people and to their names. Ronan interpreted at that time its meaning for going to Suibhne and being about to go to the land of the other's people, saying Ronan: 'I know the high king universal powerful who did not allow that the ingenuity of that man to be known by the knowledge of the heathen god of the ingenuity which was done as a fight on one side and the giving of the gift of God to his people rather than being afraid or being harmed from him, on death or on wound, on the soul from the body, on the right or on the left, on the other's ingenuity after the end or the diminution for the Coimdigh not for his people otherwise","It was said that two men of his kin were there, and they went to the king at that time to ask him to give them a portion of land for their people and for their livelihood. Ronan interpreted at that time what he meant by going to Suibhne and being willing to go to take possession of the land for the benefit of his people, saying: 'I know well the high king who is mighty in power, that he would not have given that grant of land to the knowledge of the old man of the household, unless he had made a promise to him as a pledge for his people, nor would he have allowed any danger or harm to come upon him until the time when he would be able to take possession of it, by death or by exile, from the king's court, not for his people but for himself","He was taken by two of his men to that place, and he was carried on the back of a man from his country to give a portion to his people and to their families. Ronan interpreted at that time its meaning for going to Suibhne and being ready to go against his country's enemies, as Ronan said: 'I have learned from the high king, all-powerful, that he did not allow that marriage to be made to the knowledge of the church of heaven, nor did he permit the man to give a gift of arms or the offering of battle to the other side, nor did he allow the giving of a blessing for his people or any fear or peril upon him until the day of judgment, nor any harm or injury to his soul from the body, by death or by torture, by any law or decree from the king except for his own people","It was said that two men from his kin were with him there, and he gave them the command to go to his country to bring tidings to his people and to announce their names. Ronan made known at that time his intent to go to Suibhne and to be going to his country in order that his people might know of the death of their kin, saying: 'I heard from the high king all-powerful that he did not grant that permission for the knowledge of the assembly of the god of war, nor for the giving of gifts of weapons or armor, nor for the taking of the hand of a woman to her body, on account of a wound or a burning, unless it was by the will of the people, or by the will of the king, not of his people"
"God made the world in the beginning, and once upon a time, Suibhne came to the middle of Sléibe Fúaid and began to walk there until he was tired of walking alone there, that is, he walked a mile and a half, without rest or pause, with no body or limbs, going forward and jumping over the stones before him and behind him. Once upon a time, they were in conversation together and this was their speech: 'It is a good thing,' said the first man. 'It is a bad thing,' said the second man. 'It is very good,' said the third man. 'It is a long thing,' said the fourth man. 'It is not worth it,' said the fifth man. Then they went to their own affairs. We will go now. The people of every district were assembled and the great hill was raised before him, but he did not look at it, except for the board that was set before him and the wood of the tree before him","God made the world in six days, and on the sixth day he created man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. And God said: 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.' And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them: 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.' And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day","God made the world in six days, and on the sixth day he created man from the dust of the earth, and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. And God said: 'Let us make man after our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.' So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them: 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.' And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day","God made the world in six days, and on the sixth day he created Suibhne from the bone of Sléibe Fúaid, and he gave him his shape there so that he would not be harmed by any illness there, i.e., a man of mighty stature, five cubits high, fair-haired, without body or sinews, etc., going about and leaping on the ground before and behind. Then arose among them a dispute between them, and it was said: 'It is a wolf,' said the first. 'A Ulster wolf,' said the second. 'A good beast,' said the third. 'The length of the beast,' said the fourth. 'No better than a hound,' said the fifth. Then he made his way to his own people. We ran away from him. In truth, no one would have harmed him, except that the board was not long enough for them and the wood of the tulchionn was not strong enough"
"It was a law of the ancient custom, that the grudge and the grievance, the wound and the injury, the blow and the bruise of the head after them should be avenged and should be recompensed. It was the right and the justice of that writing, that it should be in accordance with the kind of the two wrongs and the two injuries and the two wounds and the two bruises and to his cheek, so that it should be compensated by a fine and a composition of a fixed amount, according to the value of the injury and the severity of the punishment for every kind of harm done to him and all equal in every way to the damage of the tree and to the cutting of the branch with a sharp edge and on the day of the assembly, so that it was not settled until they went to the court of the judge of the people","It was a law of the ancient times that the grudging and cruel, the merciless and the savage, the violent and the injurious, should not be allowed to have power or authority after their death to make attempts or to write decrees.

It was the duty and the office of that writing to be in harmony with the kindred of their wrongs and their injuries and their wounds and their slanders and their reproach, so that it would be a matter of mourning for them and a lamentation for the slain, which would be sung from the mouth of every man by reason of the sorrowful and mournful songs of each kindred against their enemies and against all their foes in the woodlands and against the heads of the rocks with their roots and their branches, so that it was not known to them how they went about the matter of the wrongs of the people of the land","It was the law of them from that time on regarding their warlike and violent deeds, their cruel and fierce nature, their tumult and disorder, the heads after which they would strive and contend. It was the cause and origin of that writing together with the kindred of each one's kinship and of each one's inheritance and of each one's portion and of each one's share and of his own couch, so that it would be fitting for them to make peace and to give a fair division of the goods by the judgment of every man in their assembly, and of all men together regarding the branches and the roots of trees and of the rocks with a face and of the land, so that there was not one who had not gone before to the law of the ancient custom of the people"

"Afterwards Suibhne went to the place where Eorann was, and there was a woman in the house with the king's daughter, and he said to her: 'Sadhalp. That is, Eorann,' he said, 'what would be my sadhalp?' 'It is true,' said Eorann, 'and she is inside,' she said. 'I will not allow it,' said Suibhne, 'that you do not take from the people of the house of the king.' 'By me,' said the woman, 'you have no right to every day that you have had from me & from what you did not want to be in your company,' she said, 'do not go out & do not stay with us between, for a way which was not ours, your sight of that image to those who were born before you without an image themselves.' 'That is sad,' said Suibhne, 'from the wrong that was given on the side of women after those words. Once my manner was good towards the woman, from the time I gave her a gift of one hundred cows & fifty horses, and if it had been the day before you came to Oilill Cédach, king of Ua Fhaoláin, it would have been good for your sight of her'; then she said this in reply","Afterwards Suibhne went to the place where Eorann was, and there was a woman in the house with the king's daughter, and he said to her: 'Sadhalp. That is, Eorann,' he said, 'what would be my sadhalp?' 'It is true,' said Eorann, 'and she is inside,' she said. 'It is not fitting,' said Suibhne, 'that you do not take from the people of the house in the time of the king's absence.' 'By me,' said the woman, 'you have no right to mean anything to each day that you get from me & from what you don't want the sorrow of your own.' 'Do it and don't delay coming to us between, in a way that is not our sight of that image for those who were born before you with their own image.' 'That is sad,' said Suibhne, 'from the wrong that was given on the side of women after those words. Once my behavior towards women was good, in such a way that I gave one hundred cows & fifty horses, and if it had been the day before Oilill Cédach, king of Ua Fhaoláin, it would have been good for your sight.' Then she said this to him","Later Suibhne went to the place where Eorann was, and he found her in the house of the king's son, and he said: 'Sadhalp. That is, Eorann,' said he, 'what will be my sadhalp?' 'It is true,' said Eorann, 'and she is inside,' said she. 'It is not a matter of fear,' said Suibhne, 'that you did not take from the people in the house of the king.'

Once my behavior was good towards women, in such a way that I gave one hundred cows & fifty horses, and if it had been the day before you went to Oilill Cédach, king of Ua Fhaoláin, it would have been good for your appearance'; then he said this:","Then afterwards Suibhne went to the house where Eorann was, who had been chosen as a steward of the household by the king's servants, and he said to her: 'Sadhalp, that is, Eorann,' he said, 'what is your name?' 'It is true,' said Eorann, 'and she is inside,' said she. 'It is not proper,' said Suibhne, 'to ask for the name of a woman who has been given to you in marriage.' 'That is my view,' said the girl, 'not because I have any meaning in every word that you say and from which you do not desire an answer,' she said, 'but rather that you should leave it and not delay us between us, by way which your sight would not be able to perceive that form of the people who brought you forth from the womb itself.' 'That is wrong,' said Suibhne, 'from the evil which was given on the side of women after those words. Once my good fortune was with the woman in a full house, by way of giving me one hundred cows and fifty horses, and if it were a day before we went to Oilill Cédach, king of Ua Fhaoláin, it would have been good for your sight,' he said; then she spoke thus below"

"It was the custom of the Ulaid to give a man and his wife equal portions, and it was not possible for Conchulaind to obtain a portion at that time. It was customary among them that a portion was given to Conchulaind from the spoil of battle, but they gave him only a small share of the plunder and the service of a woman who was not a virgin, and it was thus with him in regard to the women of the men of Ulaid, and he was accompanied by a charioteer on that occasion, and there was a contest between them regarding the women of the men of Ulaid, and they gave him a portion according to the custom. When the battle was over, it was said that no one had ever seen such a great victory before","It was the custom of the Ulaid that Conchulaind should be given in marriage to whoever would take him as a man and his wife equally, and no one else could have him except when he was old.

And it was said that whenever a man was killed, his kinsmen would take vengeance upon the slayer","It was the custom of the Ulaid to give a man and his wife equal portions, so that nothing should be lacking for Conchulaind at that time. It was a custom among them, that the portion given to Conchulaind from the plunder would be greater than that of others, as they would divide the spoil with him in accordance with their agreement, and it was customary for them to give him a share of the women's goods and the service of a female servant, so that he might have sufficient support, and also it was customary for them to send gifts to him from the beginning, carrying tribute to him from women, giving him whatever was taken in war. And when they were about to make peace, they would give him a share of the spoils of the battle","It was known that the Ulstermen had a great man and his children as equal to him, but nothing was found of Conchulaind at that time. It was known to them that the man had been raised by Culann's hound from a boy, for he was reared with them until he grew up, and it was said that he would be a great warrior, and indeed he was in his youth, and there was no one equal to him in strength among men; and it was said that he would be the cause of many deaths and many battles, and they would make a great war upon them at that time, and they would strike with their spears and cut down their warriors and women, and it was said that he would be the one who would go against them in the coming time, and there would be a great battle between them and the men of Ulster, and they would take their lives. And it is told that it was from this that the tale began"

They divided the three sons of Esse: Enchinne and Cirí and Birí and Bailcne, three thousand others of Aiffe, and they separated them from the two sons of Scatqui. They divided them for the third time. Under the head of Scathach, they divided them, and no one knew what or who was. All that was bad, without any in the truce of Scathce, Frisan threefold, and Dono was like Aiffe in the battle, and Fodeug was with them, and it was not a good thing for Issan Doman. There were two sons of Cú Chulainn against his two sons, and no one else for the fourth time, and they did not give him anything for three times, and they gave him a loss","There was a battle between the two sons of Scathqu, in which three sons of Ilsvanaigh, namely Cuar and Cet and Cruifne, were on one side, three thousand of Aifi. I crossed over to their threefold army and their single host and their ten thousands. There came two men into the battle, namely Arnauharuch and Do Toegat, who took the hill of Slvaig, each of them taking a portion until they had divided the two sons of Idhnæ in the wrong way. They sent forth three sons of Esse: Enchinne, Cirí, and Birí, and Bailcne, three thousand others of Aiffe, and they fought against the two sons of Scatqui. They sent them against the host. Under the head of Scathach, they divided the spoil, neither knowing what or what not to take. All who were there had nothing but the two sons of Scathce, Frisan and Triar, and Dono was with Aiffe in the battle, for which Fodeug was with them, and it was not a good thing that they did. There was a battle between Cú Chulainn and his two sons, and Nu-S-leublaing against the host, and Immacomarnic did not give them to him in threefold, but they were slain","There were two sons of Scathqu who fought at the head, three sons of Ilsvanaigh, namely Cuar and Cet and Cruifne; they stood three miles from Aifi. I crossed over to their three in one and ten, and left them. There was a battle between them and the men of the north, and they took the hill of Slvaig at the first onset before the two sons of Idhnæ were wounded. They divided the three sons of Esse: Enchinne and Cirí and Birí and Bailcne, three miles from Aiffe, and forfvacarsad comlonn for the two sons of Scatqui. They gave them for the head of the class. Under the head of Scathach, they divided it; neither knew what nor what was given. All who were in the battle were without the strength of the two sons of Scathce: Frisan and Triar, and the one who was with Aiffe in the victory, fodeug and they were not in the company of the king. There were three sons of Cu Chulaind from his two sons, and Nu-s-leublaing for the head, and immacomarnic n-do-ssom friu i tríur and beuhsatar lais","There was a battle at the head of three sons of Ilsvanaigh, namely Cuar and Cet and Cruifne, and they were from three miles of Aifi.

"Aiffe's spear was aimed at Scathach. Cv Cvlaind seized Aiffi by the head and said, 'This is your punishment for your sin,' she said, 'for your two sons and your daughter.' They fought together against the fourfold shield of Cv Chulaind and Aiffi and the full force of the army. Then Cv Chulaind broke (i.e., cut) Aiffi's arm in front of Coin Cvlaind, so that six wounds were made on her sword. Said Cv Culaind: 'Aill amai!' he said, 'I will strike Aiffi and her two sons with the sharp edge of my sword until I have killed them all.' Aiffi fell to the ground. Cv Chulaind struck her in the ground and took from her both hands and feet and dragged her along by the hair, while a wild dog of Cú Culaind bit her with him, so that she was wounded on the body and the head. Said Aiffi: 'Mercy, O Cú Chulaind!' said she. 'My three sons are in my care!' he said. 'I will not spare you nor your trial,' said she. 'It is three sons,' said he, 'who were given to Scathach without any ransom from me afterwards, and I gave them as a gift to her for the sake of the land and for the sake of the son of Dam.' 'I am sorry for that,' said she. 'They will be avenged for this injury.' Then Cv Chulaind went to Aiffi and struck her with this very blow. Said afterwards to Aiffi: 'You are a daughter and a mother.' 'I was given by the gods seven years ago to h-Érin,' said she, 'and I will give you a name.' Cv Chulaind gave a golden ornament and said about it that it would be carried in the land of h-Érinn until the ornament is full and the name is known, so that it would be known as the name of Conlui and said about it that it would not be hidden from the people nor would the people hide it from her, nor would they take away the daughter of the people","Aiffe's spear was aimed at Scathach. Cv Cvlaind seized Aiffi by the head and said, 'I will not let you go until you teach me your skill,' and Scathach replied: 'It is this that I have taught you,' she said, 'the two strikes and the parry.' They fought together before the company of Cv Chulaind and Aiffi and the warriors of the host. Then Cv Cvlaind broke (i.e., cut) Aiffi's arm for Coin Cvlaind, so that six wounds were made on her sword. Said Cv Culaind: 'Aill amai!' he said, 'I will strike you, Aiffi, and your two strikes in the hollow of your shoulder.' Aiffi fell to the ground. Cv Chulaind struck her on the ground and took from her both hands and feet and threw them far away as if they were a single thing, while the wild dogs of Cú Chulaind devoured them with him, and they were cast upon the plain of Dii and the sword was broken in two. Said Aiffi: 'Pity on me, O Cú Chulaind!' she said. 'My three strikes are in me!' he said. 'It is not a strike nor a test that I have given you,' she said. 'It is three strikes,' he said, 'which I gave to Scathach without her ever repaying me afterwards, and I will repay you for your teaching me the art of war and for the battle which you fought with the men of Munster and for the son of Dam.' 'I am not worthy of that,' she said. 'It is fitting that you should have this reward.' Then Cv Chulaind went to Aiffi and gave her this gift, saying: 'You are a great warrior and a noble son.' 'I will live seven years in Erin,' she said, 'and I will give you a name.' Cv Chulaind struck the spear of gold and silver and made it fly through the air until it reached Erin when the spear was full of gold and silver, and he proclaimed that her name would be known throughout Erin as long as the spear was full of gold and silver, and not otherwise.","Aiffe's purpose was to attack Scathach. Cv and Cú Chulaind set out towards Aiffe, and the woman said: 'This is what I am seeking,' she said, 'to take from her two eyes and her carpat.' They proceeded together towards the place of the fourfold cliss of Cú Chulaind and Aiffe and the gathering of the cumleng. Then Cú Chulaind broke (i.e., cut) after Aiffe's arm for Coin Cú Chulaind, so that six wounds were made on her sword. It was said by Scathach: 'Aill amai!' he said, 'strike upon Aiffe and her two eyes carpat from the gleam of the conidnapatar.' Aiffe fell into the sotain. Cú Chulaind struck at the sotain and took from each of them a cichib and dompert tarsnai amail assclaing, and they fought with a wild gona slvagu bodein Cú Chulaind with him, and the battle was fought on the talmain dii and the beurt claideb urnocht vasti. Aiffe said: 'Anmoin in anmain, O Cú Chulaind!' she said. 'My three drinnrvisc are upon me!' he said. 'It is not a true battle nor a test of strength,' she said. 'It is three drinnroisc,' he said, 'which I have given to Scathach without any reward from her afterwards, and I have promised you my own wealth from the belaibh di dunaicch fen and co rucai mac dam.' 'Atmaur-sa amlaid,' she said. 'This is what was decreed for you in that matter.' Then Cú Chulaind went to Aiffe and gave her this aidqi. Later, he said to Aiffe: 'You are a great warrior and son of a noble man.' 'Cvirfed-sai,' she said, 'div dia secht m-bliadan co h-Érin h-e,' she said, '& facaib-se ainm do.' Cú Chulaind gave dornnaisc n-oir n-do and proclaimed it in the name of the tissad dia cvingid-seum co h-Érinn in tan bvd lan in dornnaisc dia meor & ispert co m-bad é a ainm do bretha n-dov Conlui & aspert frie nacha slonnad d'oinfir & nacha m-beurad oinfer dia sligid & na rodobad comlonn ainfir","Aiffe set out in pursuit of Scathach. Cv and Cvlaind placed Aiffi's head on the point of a spear, and they said that it was her who had done the deed. Scathach said: 'It was she who did the deed,' she said, 'with her two hands and with her sword.' They carried them forth before the company of Cv Cvlaind and Aiffi and their warriors. Afterward, Aiffi broke her arm against the shield of Cvlaind, so that six wounds were made upon her spear. Thus spoke Cú Cvlaind: 'Alas!' he said, 'they have cast Aiffi and her two hands into the pit of the wolves.' Aiffi fell to the ground. Cú Cvlaind struck her in the side with his sword and took from her the two arms and the shoulder, and then they dragged them across the plain, while Cú Cvlaind fought against a wild beast which was by him, until he overcame it, and he gave the beast to Aiffi's people for their burial and for the weapons of the warriors. Then said Aiffi: 'O my soul, O my soul, O Cú Cvlaind!' she said. 'My threefold wound is upon me,' said he. 'I have been wounded in three places,' said she. 'It was three wounds,' said he, 'which Scathach inflicted on her without giving her any revenge after that, and which I suffered for your sake in the battle with the men of Dunchad and with the sons of Mac Damm.' 'You are my beloved,' said she. 'Let it be known that you were so.' Then went Cú Cvlaind to Aiffi, and he took from her the head of this woman. Then spoke afterward to her: 'You are a monster and the daughter of a demon,' she said, 'and I will make you suffer for seven years in Erin.' And she said, 'And I shall give your name out.' Cú Cvlaind made a vow that he would not return to Erin until the land was full of gold, and that he would announce it throughout the world with his voice when the land was full of gold, and that its name should be given as the name of Conlui, and that it should be proclaimed that none should ever understand the language of infernal beings nor should they speak in the tongue of infernal beings, nor should they be able to make a shield from the materials of infernal beings"

"Cu Chulainn went to Crufóid. A woman gave him her name with that encounter. He took the great battle-cry of the men who were in that place, and he made a loud cry over the blood-stained streams for every warrior. 'This is the wound of the spear today, Cu Chulainn!' said the girl. Then from that, the daughter of Croofoit, i.e., the daughter of the spear, went to the battle before Ath an Imfoit against Boinn. Emiur fell upon him with a club. Then Cu Chulainn took his shield before the direction of the cry, and he made a loud cry over the wounds of the men and the horses across the ford. He made a loud cry over the wounds of the men and the horses for another ford. Then from that, Ath n-Imfhoid was taken by the two sides, against and alongside","Cu Chulainn went to Crufóid. A woman gave him her name with that greeting. He took the great battle-cloaks of the warriors who were in that place, and he cast the blood-stained shields over every warrior. 'This is the red of the wound today, Cu Chulainn!' said the girl. Then from that, the daughter of Croofoit, i.e., the red, went to the battle for Ath an Imfoit against Boinn. Emiur fell before him with a spear. Then Cu Chulainn took the shield for the path, casting the sinew of the foal's hide over the horses' backs. He cast another shield over the horses' backs for the other side. Then from that, Ath n-Imfhoid was taken by the two sides, and all","Cu Chulainn went to Crufóid. There was a woman whose name was that one. She gave them her great battle-spoils for the warriors who were in that place, and she made a peace between the two factions. 'This is the blood of this man today, Cu Chulainn!' said the woman. Then they went from there to the hill of Croofoit, i.e., the blood. They went to the battle-field before Ath an Imfhoid for Boinn. Emiur was killed by them with a spear. Then Cu Chulainn took up the shield against the side and cut off the head of the bull that was in front of him.

Then they went from there to Ath n-Imfhoid because of the two heads which were given to them, and also because of the other","Cu Chulainn went to Crufóid. A woman gave him her name in return. She made a great outcry before the people assembled there, crying out the names of the slain who were present, and the blood of the warriors ran over every path.

The battle was fought before Ath an Imfhoid for Boinn. Emiur fell upon him with a spear. Then Cu Chulainn struck down the warriors in front of the army, killing the men who had crossed over to the other side. He struck down others who were on that side, killing the men and horses who had crossed over from the other side. Then Ath n-Imfhoid was taken by those who had crossed over from there and from elsewhere"
"What did the woman do who killed Cú Chulainn, a hundred men before each ford from Ath Scénmenn to Ollbíne to Boind m-Breg and the companions of that woman were slain in the battle and they went safely afterwards? Then came Eimhear, the daughter of Cráebuaidh Concopuir, to the aid of the Ulaid with a host and she brought them victory. There was a man who had been wounded by the Ulaid, namely Bricne Nemtenga mac Carbad. Conad said then, 'It is not fitting for you,' he said, 'to go to Cú Chulainn tonight to meet him and the young woman will be at the feast with Concopair tonight, for it is less dangerous to have a hundred women of the Ulaid in the house.' Then Coin Culainn was not satisfied with that advice and went against his own counsel, and he went forth with his men to fight against the Ulaid, and they went out from the house with their weapons and they went away leaving the house empty","What did the woman do who killed Cú Chulainn, a hundred men before each ford from Ath Scénmenn to Ollbíne to Boind m-Breg and the companions of that woman were slain in the battle and they went safely afterwards?

There was a man who had been wounded by the Ulaid, namely Bricne Nemtenga mac Carbad. Conad then said: 'It is fitting for you,' he said, 'to go to Cú Chulainn tonight and ask him to give you his protection tonight and the young woman will come to your feast tonight, for it is less than a hundred women of the Ulaid who are in danger.' Then Coin Culainn heard that speech and then went to the place where the company was, and there he found them with their weapons ready against the coming of the enemy and they went out to meet them","What did the woman do who was killed by Cú Chulainn, hundred men before each ford from Ath Scenmenn to Ollbine to Boind m-Breg and the company of them in the girl's form and they went safely afterwards? Then Conranic Emvin Machai said in that assembly. At that time Eimech was brought by Cræbruaidh Concopuir to the good of Ulaid and their men were given a choice. There was a man who gave a gift to Ulltaib, namely Bricne Nemtengai son of Carbad. Then Conad said in his speech: 'It is fitting for you,' he said, 'to go with Cú Chulainn tonight and the little woman will come to your feast tonight, for it is lesser to have a hundred women from the Ulaid than one man.' Then Coin Culaind was not satisfied with that saying and then he went to the place where the company was and he gave them their share before the assembly and they went out afterwards in sorrow","What did the woman say who was killed by Cú Chulainn, hundred men before each ford from Ath Scénmenn to Ollbíne to Boind m-Breg and calling upon the gods of that deed, and then went away safely afterwards, after Conranach Emvin Macha, who had a beautiful face. Atnagar Eimech was given to Eimhear issan Cráebuaidh Concopuir by the men of Ulster, as a gift and for service. There were two warriors who came from Ulster, namely Bricne Nemtennach son of Carbad. Conad then said, 'It is fitting for you,' he said, 'that Cú Chulainn would guard you tonight and the small woman would appear to Concopuir tonight, because it is less to be ashamed than a hundred women from Ulster who would be disgraced.' Then Coin Culaind was satisfied with that speech and then went out into the battlefield, where he fought with his men against the forces of the enemy in the middle of the battle and then went out again in sorrow"
"It is a great shame,' said Cathbad, 'but it is not the king's geis that I have broken, but Bricne's geis which I have broken. You would have Cu Chulainn remain in his own land forever,' said he. 'Cu Chulainn must be killed!' said Conchobar, 'so that the noble blood of the Tuatha Dé Danann may not be polluted.' Then came Cu Chulainn. 'I will fight you,' said he, 'and I will throw your head to the dogs of Sliep Fuid.' Then came Cu Chulainn and was not afraid of his own death or of the wounds of the men or of the weapons of every kind that were brought against him in Sliep Fuid, nor did he give way before them until the time of the battle of Emhain. Then they went to meet him with their forces for the battle of Cu Chulainn","It is a great shame,' said Cathbad, 'but it is not the king's geis that I have broken concerning Bricne. You would have Cu Chulainn remain in his own land forever,' he said. 'Cu Chulainn must be killed!' said Conchobar, 'so that the noble blood of the Tuatha Dé Danann may not be polluted.' Then Cu Chulainn fell. 'I will die,' said he, 'and I shall cast my soul into the arms of Slepn Fhuaid.' Then Cu Chulainn departed, and was not seen again in his own land, nor with his kinsmen, nor with his companions, nor with any of the goodly men of Ulster, but rather with evil spirits in Slepn Fhuaid, and he did not give his soul to them until the time of the battle of Emhain. Then they came to him from the east for the sake of Cú Chulainn","It is a great shame,' said Cathbad, 'but it is not the king's geis that I have broken, but Bricne's. You would have been Cu Chulainn forever in your father's house,' he said. 'Cu Chulainn will be killed!' said Conchobar, 'the loss of the swift-footed one who bore the bróthar.' Then came Cu Chulainn. 'I am wounded,' said he, 'and I throw down my spear to Slépé Fíad.' Then came Cu Chulainn and was not able to move from his place in front of the hounds and the horses and the chariots and all the weapons of every kind that were in Sleip Fíad, and did not give his arms to him until he had passed through the faith of Emna. Then came to him his foster-father for the taking of the cattle from Cú Chulainn","It is a great shame and,' said Cethbad, 'but I have given the king no oath of Bricren to break. You would have Cu Chulainn remain in his own land forever,' he said. 'Let Cu Chulainn be slain!' said Conchobar, 'let the young men of the household strike him.' Then Cu Chulainn fell. 'I will fight you,' said he, 'and I shall throw your shields and spears to Sliep Fuaid.' Then Cu Chulainn went forth and was not afraid of his own people nor of those who had been given him or of every kind of bad weapon in Sliep Fuaid, and he did not let them strike him until they were all worn out by the battle of Emna. They came to him afterwards and gave him a great offering for Cu Chulainn"
"The warrior struck him in the breast with a spear. It was a famous combat, a contest of strength and skill: Emer gave a feast to Conchobar the ancient, and Fercus and Cathbad their attendants, and they made a covenant with the wife of Cú Chulainn and the daughter of Vlaid for the sake of their beauty. They made a truce then and the warrior took his leave. Conchobar gave a reward to Emer for her hospitality. He decreed a law for the men of Ulster, that they should not take the wife of Cú Chulainn or the daughter of Vlaid until they had been properly married","The warrior struck him in the breast with a spear. It was a grievous wound, a cruel blow: Emer gave a feast to Cú Chulainn and the men of Ulster, and Fergus and Cathbad their portions; they made a truce with Conchobar and the women of Ulster went to the house of Cú Chulainn and brought him drink. After that, he was wounded and struck down. Conchobar gave a command concerning Emer's marriage. He decreed that no man should be allowed to take her in wedlock unless he had fought against Cú Chulainn and had won his victory, and none should be slain without cause","The warrior, whom I have mentioned in Ulster, was the son of Cingin. It is said that he was a companion of Emer, who was married to Conchobar, and with Fercus and Cathbad, the druids of the king's court, they were companions of Conchobar and the woman, who was called Vlad, the daughter of the king. After this, they went on a journey together and the warrior took a companion. Conchobar made an agreement with Emer concerning the marriage. He gave a judgment to the company of Conchobar and ordered the druids to prepare the feast, and no one would be allowed to sit until all had eaten","The warrior struck the Ulstermen in the battle of the ancient king. It is said that the woman was a companion to him: Emer gave her hand in marriage to Cú Chulainn, and Fergus and Cathbad their sons were fostered by him. After that, he made them all go away. Conchobar ordered the writing of Emir's genealogy. He made a judgment concerning the men of Cú Chulainn, and gave a reward for his victory, and no one was allowed to sit down until the battle was finished"
