"There is a certain tale of Suibhne, and the great Moling was greatly moved by the clearness of that tale as one might be, and a stone was cast at every man in the company of Suibhne. 'Let the man who is in this company speak,' said Moling, 'for I have heard that they are not in the place where the peace of the world is, but rather in the place of the wildness of the wolves. It is a great sorrow to me to see Suibhne, that is, the man in this company, on the top of that hill, that is, the hill called Gealta, for it is not the custom of men nor of women nor of children to be in the place of the wildness of wolves. Let every other tale be heard or not, but Suibhne's tale'; thus said Moling","There was a great lament for the death of Suibhne, and Molling was greatly angered at the clearness of the sky as one fris and stones were thrown at every man in the leath of Suibhne. 'This is the man who is in this leath,' said Molling, 'I have not seen a man like him since the time when I was in the peace of the meeting of the people of the district. I was angry to see Suibhne, that is, the one in this leath, on the top of the hill called Tiupra, which is Tiupra of Gealta by name, for it is not a place where a man would be seen or heard, nor a place where a man would be known or recognized from the meeting of the people of the district. I was angry at every other thing besides this, and Molling said:","There is a great lament for Suibhne, and Moling is very angry at the clearness of the wind as one fris and the stone is thrown by every man in the teaching of Suibhne. 'This is the man who is in this teaching,' said Moling, 'I have seen the men in the place where they are not in the calm of the assembly of the wolves of this place. I was angry to see Suibhne, that is, the man who is in this teaching on the top of the hill called Tiupra, which is the hill called Gealta, for it is a great matter that the wind should be clear and the stone be thrown by every man in the teaching of Suibhne.' 'This is the man who is not in any other place,' said Moling:","It is a long time since I heard of Suibhne, and the great anger of Moling at the clearness of the matter as one thing, and the stone being brought by every man to Suibhne's leech. 'This is the man who has been leached,' said Moling, 'I will not be in that place where I was in the time when the clean and pure were in a covenant with the people of the land. I was angry at seeing Suibhne, that is, the one from whom this leech came, on the top of the hill, that is, Tiupra Tioprat§na Gealta, for it is my belief that the clearness and the brightness were in a covenant with the people of the land. It was anger that made me see Suibhne, i.e., from whom this leech came, on the top of that hill called Tiupra Tioprat§na Gealta, because I had been in covenant with them.' And Moling said"
"There is a man who has been struck by the blow of a stone. 'Because of the act of the deed, O my man,' said Suibhne, 'that is my punishment without any cause, for I do not allow the festival of the church from the fall of the stones of the walls.' 'If you are to be killed in this way,' said the man, 'then I will not be able to bear it even though it is great for me to be a servant of the devil.' 'By Christ, O man,' said he, 'I do not allow your service on any church or on the altar, for the sake of the soul of another man from the back of my own. From the time when God gave me and was born small in the womb of the woman, and I took a little from God's grace from the woman, and it is not a matter of the side of the woman in her own right on the land of the unchastened.' 'Mercy upon Christ, O man,' said Moling, 'because of the act of the deed, a great blow to you and a turning back from the doing of the deed of the deed.' 'It is not your fault that I am struck,' said Suibhne, 'for when the stones are broken in front of me and I will be killed for the church.' 'A blessing upon you, O man,' said Moling, 'that is, a support from the side of the church for your soul,' and the priest set out to go with them, that is Suibhne, Mongán and Moling","There is a man who has been struck by the sword. 'As for the act of vengeance, my dear man,' said Suibhne, 'that is my punishment without any cause, and I will not allow this festival of the church from the fall of the people of the covenant of the covenant.' 'If you are to be killed in your place,' said the man, 'then I will not be able to bear it even though it is great for me to be a servant of the devil.' 'By Christ, O man,' said he, 'I do not consider this punishment of the church from the beginning of the world until the end of the world. From the time of God's creation and the making of the small and the large, I have been struck by the sword here and have taken a little from God in the matter of the women.' 'Mercy upon Christ, O man,' said Moling, 'as for the act of vengeance, you are to be struck and if you go back from the act of the covenant of the covenant.' 'You are not to be struck by your own sword,' said Suibhne, 'for I have been struck with a sharp weapon in my heart and will be killed for the covenant.' 'I give you this blessing,' said Moling, 'that is, a companion from the beginning of the world for your help,' and the priest went to the three: Suibhne, Mongán and Moling","There is a man who spoke thus: 'As for the act of justice, my lord,' said Suibhne, 'that is, my punishment without any cause, for I will not allow this festival of the people of the world from the falsehood of the sin of the people of the world.' 'If you are to live in peace,' said the man, 'then it is not your own soul that will be burned, though great is the fire of the wrath of God upon me.' 'By Christ, O man,' said he, 'it is not your soul which is placed upon a single scale against the weight of the soul of another man upon the scales of my soul. From the beginning of the world until now, I have been given a small portion of the glory of God and have taken a small portion from God for the sake of the woman, and it is not that the side of the woman is on the other side of the woman in relation to the land of the world.' 'Mercy upon Christ, O man,' said Moling, 'as for the act of justice, it is a great shame upon you, and the fire will be turned back from the action of the act of justice.' 'It is not that I am wronged by your judgment,' said Suibhne, 'for if I am to be given a small portion of the glory of God and I shall be in my punishment for the form of justice.' 'Let this be the fate of Eric,' said Moling, 'that is, a companion of the companions from you,' and the laity of them, that is Suibhne, Mongán and Moling:","The priest said to the bishop: 'Because of the action of the righteous deed, O my lord,' said Suihne, 'that is my death without any cause and I do not permit it to be in the festival of the people of the gospel from the beginning of the world.' 'If you are going to die thus, O my lord,' said the bishop, 'then it is not a matter for me to allow the holy one of the gospel.' 'According to Christ, O man,' said he, 'it is not in my power to bring a single person into the gospel from the time of the gospel of the people who are on earth; for if I have been blessed by God and am small among you, then I do not allow my death from that, nor do I receive anything from God until the people of the world.' 'Mercy upon Christ, O bishop,' said Molling, 'because of the action of the righteous deed, be merciful to me and let me go away, and if there is a trial of the work of the righteous deed.' 'It is not in your hand to allow it, O my lord,' said Suihne, 'for I have been bound by the evil of the world and I will die for the sake of righteousness.' 'I beg you for mercy upon me,' said Molling, 'that is, a gift of mercy from me for you,' and he said that the prayer of the righteous was in their support, namely Suihne, Mongan and Molling"
"With the help of the Lord, Suibhne went to Connacht with a band of brave men, and he was led by the holy man of the church to the place where the great battle took place at All Fharannáin in the land of Tír Fhíachrach Múaidhe; a valley of fire, a stream of fire, a writing of fire and a flame that burned the skin. The people of the land were divided into two parts: the noble and the humble who were in the battle of the holy and the faithful with the help of the holy. A tree of mercy was given to him for the sake of the righteous and the unjust; it was the unjust who were in that place. After the coming from the great sea, he went into that land. The house of Suibhne was made greater than that battle, so he chose to be a ruler and gave his protection to those above him; thus said the priest","Of the Laith of Suibhne, and of the gathering of the Críche of Connacht to the house of the noble and good man, that it was made for the god of All Fharannáin to the land of Fíachrach Múaidhe; a glen of Áloinn, a stream of Áloinn, a scribbler of teibersain, a tinsnach of frisin all aill; anúas and bennachadh in that which was made by the old holy and faithful with the help of the god. A branch of caomháil to the birth of the great fruitful ones within all this. It was good that the eimh of eidheann, the true ruler and aball of cenntrom, was made with a crookedness towards talmain with the great fruitfulness, it was good that nobhíttis was in that allt, and allta and míola muighe and muca mórthroma; it was good that rón roiremhar rochodladh was after the coming from the great sea to this all. Roshann~taigh Suibhne with the great of that ionadh, so that he would be chosen for adhmoladh and giving a túaragbhála over the aird; so that the laoidh-si would say","With the help of the holy men and the blessed angels, the Lord brought the soul of Suibhne from Connacht to the holy place of All Fharannáin in the land of Tír Fíachrach Múaidhe; a valley of love, a stream of love, a writing of love, and a tear of love. The holy and blessed one, who is in the company of the saints and the faithful, it was the same with them. A tree of mercy towards the righteous, in the place of the soul. It was the same with the soul of Suibhne, the true light and the pillar of truth, to go from the valley to the hill where the soul of the righteous is. It was a matter of grace that he was in the place of the soul after coming from the great sea. The house of Suibhne was built with much love, to be chosen for glory and to give testimony before the high ones; so let it be said by the holy men","Aroile laithe do Suibhne ag cúartugudh críche Connacht go hudmhall anbhsaidh go ttarla é fo dheóidh go hAll Fharannáin a tTír Fhíachrach Mhúaidhe; glenn áloinn eisidhén, sruth áloinn sriobhúaine ag teibersain tepersin§co tinnesnach frisin all aill§ anúas & bennachadh ann ina rabadar senadh náomh & fíreóin co hiomdha iolarrdha, et ba hiomdha annp. ámh crann caomháloinn co ttoirthibh troma tóthachtacha isin all hisin.

"There was a gathering of Suibhne in the house of the bishop of Moling, that is, in Teach Moling. It was his custom to have the psalms of Caomhghin in the assembly of Moling for the benefit of the people of the church. There was also a gathering of Suibhne for the assembly of the clergy and for the reading of the Psalms; and they went forth to eat bread. 'Because of this long journey, O men of the church,' said the priest; and then the abbot of Moling and Suibhne replied","Táinic Suibhne roime fo dheóidh conuige an baile i raibhe Moling .i.

Moling ordered the men to go forth with their weapons in that matter, and he gave them a command to take the white cow which was given to him. By the name of Mugná, from her it was that the wife of Moling was made. It was she who was the mother of those weapons, i.e., the head of the spear and the shield of the man in the battle, for the sake of Suibhne.

"When the daughter of Adhaigh was in the house of Eitir Mhuirghil and the woman of the household, the other girl said: 'As I have seen you,' she said, 'is it not better for you to take another man and not to take your own man who is in the court, where the grief that is in the house of your daughter is at a high place.' Then the girl went out from the house and the girl did not say anything else until Mhuirghil went on the morning of the day of the fair to go to Suibhne of the household who was as good as the fál in the ríachtain.

The boy asked about the girl's condition, and he went on to be in the house and to go to the hill and to take his hand to the left of the robói for alchuing, and to go to the amus of the grief. From the morning came the grief and its sorrow with him and he was in the luidhe at the time of spending his proinnes in the household.

And if you do that, then you will be safe.' Then Eitir went out from that house and did not say anything more until Mhuirghil went in the morning to the place of the cow, going to Suibhne of the goodly house who was as kind as a friend.

"There was a great lament in the land concerning him, and the people of the country were greatly grieved at his death; and the people of the land were greatly distressed. Ronan was made to understand the meaning of this time for the purpose of going forth to Suibhne and being in the way of going to the land of the other people, according to the agreement of Rónán: 'I have heard that the king is a wise and powerful ruler who did not allow that marriage to be made to the daughter of the old man, for the sake of the people of the country or the people of the land; nor did he permit any injury or harm to them, but rather he gave them peace and safety from their enemies, from their own people, from the evil of the world, from the fire of the sword, from the wound of the spear, from the sorrow of the soul, from the grief of the heart. And I have heard that God has given him a place in heaven for his people or for the people of the land; nor did he permit any injury or harm to them, but rather he gave them peace and safety from their enemies, from their own people, from the evil of the world, from the fire of the sword, from the wound of the spear, from the sorrow of the soul, from the grief of the heart","There was a great assembly of the people there, and a great crowd of them in the city to give birth to a child to their tribe and to their children. Rofoillsigedh gave to Ronan that time his meaning to go to Suibhne and to be going with him to his land for the benefit of his tribe, co n-ébairt Rónán: 'I have heard the King of all power, who did not allow that birth to the knowledge of the young man in the old man's house, but he gave a great gift to the people and to their children, and to the child of the woman, for the good of his tribe or for the bad of them, according to the decision of the Council which was not for the benefit of his tribe, but for the good of them.'","Thaoinic taom dá chéill dó annsin & doluidh roime ar amus a thíre do thabairt taobha re a muintir & do anmhuin aca.

Then arose a great cry from them, and they spoke thus: 'Let it go,' said the first. 'Let it go,' said the second. 'A good length,' said the third. 'A long length,' said the fourth.

'A long journey indeed,' said the fourth speaker. 'No good is this journey,' said the fifth speaker. Then they turned their backs upon their own people, and went on their way; and the people of every tribe and kindred were in the glen, but no one would go near him, except that he was not allowed to go beyond the board from which he came, nor to the place where the people of the tribe were.","God protect the son of Rónáin, and at that time when Suibhne was in the middle of Sléibe Fúaid, he was surrounded by his enemies around him, and there was a great difficulty for him there in his battle.

Then arose a great cry from them, and they cried out: 'Let him go,' said the first man. 'Let him go,' said the second man. 'Let him go with good will,' said the third man. 'Let him go with a long journey,' said the fourth man. 'Let him go to the fair of Ríamh,' said the fifth man. Then they went in sorrow towards their own place. They were not at all prepared for this, and all the people of the world were surprised at it, but no one was more surprised than the board from which he came and his own people","God protect the King of Ireland, and there was once a time when Suibhne, with the aid of the king of Sléibe Fúaid, pursued his course in that place, and the druidic magic of the kings there was such that they would make their enemies suffer a fate more bitter than death in that place. That is, the power of a certain kind of magic which was a head without a collar & five heads of gaoiside, with an iron chain, with no body, no bones, and they would sing & leap over a smooth slope backward & forward. Once, the enemies were caught by a sudden blow from a hidden place, and they would be beaten to death; 'Let it go,' said the first man. 'Let it be,' said the second man. 'It is good for the length of time,' said the third man. 'It is long enough,' said the fourth man. 'No more than a short journey,' said the fifth man. The king's enemies were all brought together.

For every old man and woman & for the great valley of the hill, do not make it to be near him; but don't bring the board in from outside and into the house, nor bring your children in from abroad"
"It was a law of the ancient times, to the ungrateful and the unjust, the deceitful and the treacherous, the sinner and the heretic, the false and the corrupt, concerning the heads after their judgment, to be exiled and to be banished. It was the punishment and the torment of that decree together with the long suffering of the head for their sins and for their sorrows and for their misdeeds and for their slanders and for their wounds and for their injuries and for their bruises, so that they would be made a mockery of them and a reproach to them, and from the root of their pride and from the lofty height of their arrogance, each head for their own sake and for their own purpose, and all the people in general, together with the fruits of their labor and the produce of their fields, so that they would not be able to take anything from the land or from the sea or from the air or from the sky or from the sun or from the moon","It was a law of the ancient times, to the ungrateful and the unjust, the deceitful and the treacherous, the cruel and the merciless, concerning the heads after their slaughter, to be in the hands of the strong and in the grasp of the mighty. It was the custom and the tradition of that writing with the longs of the head and of the hair and of the beard and of the locks and of the curls and of the plaited hair, and of the smoothness of the skin, so that it might be a comfort to them and a joy to their hearts, in order that they might not be in the hands of the enemies and of the wicked and of the cruel and of the merciless and of the deceitful ones, but rather in the hands of those who are kind and gentle and who are good and upright, so that it may be a comfort to them and a joy to their hearts","It was a lord in the time of Uathbhas, to the greedy and the plunderer, to the sinner and the corrupter, to the liar and the deceiver of the head after the destruction and after the scattering; it was the traitor and the destroyer of that writing together with the length of the head from its birth and from its growth and from its strength and from its beauty and from its grace, together with the good things which were in it and the fair things which were in it, and from the gold which was in it and the silver which was in it; to the lofty and the noble from the high places of the sky, to the wise and the understanding from the knowledge of the people and from their wisdom and from their learning and from their skill; and that which was not in the beginning, but that which was afterwards, and that which was not in the first place, but that which was afterwards, and that which was not in the middle place, but that which was afterwards","It was the law of the king regarding the valuing and the giving and the receiving of gifts and the granting of lands, that the chieftain after having been established and settled in his position should advance and proceed to the examination and to the trial. It was the right and the judgment of this decree together with the length of the chief's rule and the number of the people and of the houses and of the lands and of the walls and of the side of the hill, that the person, who was in the position of the chief with the support of a good and abundant supply, should be taken from the hidden and the hidden treasure of the people, by the king's wisdom and by the king's secret, to every chief for the purpose of a place and for the purpose of a portion of the land, so that the king would be in agreement with all the men of the forest and with all the chieftains of the woodlands with a good and abundant supply, according to their own wishes"
"There was a great sorrow there; and the man who had been in the company of the king and queen of Slieve Eadneach, Aidneach§, for he was very wise in the knowledge of the oaths of the kings and queens of that place, went to ask for a great gift from them; and he said: 'A great sorrow is upon me because of the loss of the daughter and son on Slíabh Fúaid,' said he, 'but I would rather have my own son's death than this sorrow; for it is better to die in battle than to live in disgrace.'","There was a great sorrow there; and the man who had been in the company of the king and queen, and who had been in the company of the king's men, was not to be found. It was not the man who had been in the company of the king and queen, nor the man who had been in the company of the king's men, but it was the man who had been in the company of the king's men, that was not to be found. And there was a great sorrow there; and the man who had been in the company of the king and queen, and who had been in the company of the king's men, was not to be found. It was not the man who had been in the company of the king and queen, nor the man who had been in the company of the king's men, but it was the man who had been in the company of the king's men, that was not to be found","There was a great lament there; and thus the man of the house, who had been in the company of the king's men, said: 'A curse upon him that is a thief or a coward, for he has broken the peace of the king and his people, and he will not be able to stand before them again, unless he makes amends with gold or with blood; go then to the house of the king and of the queen in Slieve Eoghain, Aidneach, for there is a great assembly there.' And thus they went on their way; and thus the man of the house, who had been in company with the king's men, said: 'A curse upon him that is a thief or a coward, for he has broken the peace of the king and his people, and he will not be able to stand before them again, unless he makes amends with gold or with blood; go then to the house of the king and of the queen in Slieve Eoghain, Aidneach, for there is a great assembly there.' And thus they went on their way","When the sons of Cian and the men of Cian went into battle against the sons of Ghabh, and the men of Conn, then a great rout was made by the sons of Badar, and they carried off the children of the king's house from the middle of the host. And it was not known whether the rout was caused by the weakness or the strength of that host, for neither did the men of the host know nor understand how to fight against them. Then came the sons of Eochu and Eithneach, Aodhneach, who had been in great trouble before this time, and they came to meet them at the mouth of Slieve Fad. Great was the cry there; but a man from the host said: 'Olc éimh atáthar agom anocht a haithle na caillighe & na ccenn ar Slíabh Fúaid,' said he, 'but not as good as my own son, for I have no sons to fight against them; though I would rather have had my son to fight with them, for it is better than the sorrow of this.' And so they went on"
"At the time of Suibhne in Luachair Dheadhadh for a battle; they went to the place of the assembly of the warriors of the army, and they were in the place of the gathering of the people of Fiodh, shining and bright, and of Gaible. The year of that dark one and from it came food for them, namely, the flesh of a cow, of a sheep, of a goat, and of a pig; namely, the river from the named source of Fiodh, and they made a truce with Suibhne in the place of that battle, so that he might be safe, and they made a peace with the laity of the church.","It was the season of Aroile for Suibhne in Luachair Dheadhadh, for the purpose of the battle; he went to the place where the battle was to be fought towards the plain of Fiodh, shining and bright, where Gaible was. The year of that dark one and from it came a birth to him of a son of that year, namely a ram with a red head, which was broken and cut in two by the black-haired deer and by the water of Gabhla, namely the river from the named place of Fiodh; thus he would have been able to go forth in that battle, but because of the bad omens of the harp and the loud cry of the birds against Suibhne in the course of that battle, he was not able to do so","There was a great famine in Suibhne at Luachair Dheadhadh for the purpose of the warriors; they went to sit in their places of gathering in the place of the bright and shining Fiodh, the clear and gleaming Gégalloinn Gaible. The year of that darkness and its end was a time of life for him, i.e., the year of the white boar, the red cow, the black sheep, and the deer of Gabhla, i.e., the river from the named place of Fiodh, and from there he took the strong and vigorous Tuirsi and the double of the deer of Antí for Suibhne in the force of that time to be a good man, and thus he was able to do so","Aroile (i.e., the tale) of the time of Suibhne in Luachair Dheadhadh for a (i.e., regarding) the battle of the sons; went to sit in that (i.e., in this) place of the assembly of the noble and good men, going to the land of Fiodh, glansrothach (i.e., bright), of Gaible. A (i.e., a certain) year of that dark (i.e., of that time), and as also from the land (i.e., from the place) for a food of his own in that year, i.e., a wild boar, a slaughtered pig, a swan with a broken wing, and a deer of dark-hued skin, and a fish of the Gabhla, i.e., the river from the name-giving (i.e., named after) Fiodh; and thus he (Suibhne) went to the forest in that time for a holy (i.e., sacred or consecrated) place to dwell in, and so (i.e., accordingly) he was given a gift of a large and good horse:"
"Afterwards, Suibhne went to the place where Eorann was, and he found Eorann in the house of the king, with a band of men about him. He said: 'Sadhalp, this is, O Eorann,' said he, 'what is your Sadhalp?' 'It is true,' said Eorann, 'and it is not in my power to go back,' said she. 'It is not for me,' said Suibhne, 'to be the one who would not have given a place to the people of the house.' 'To me,' said the woman, 'no more than your will to every day that you have, and what you love in the world,' said she, 'do not let it go from you, nor let it be taken from you between us, for it is not our sight which would make a difference to those who are in the house.' 'That is true,' said Suibhne, 'as a matter of fact, after these words. Once was good my intention towards the woman, and I had given her a place of safety, so that she might have a place of rest, for three years of cows and horses, and if it were not for the day when we went to Oilill Cédach, king of Ua Fhaoláin, who was good in regard to my sight.' Then, there was a silence.","Afterwards, Suibhne went to the place where Eorann was, and he found Eorann in the house of the king, engaged in a conversation with a woman. He said: 'Sadhalp, this is, Eorann,' said he, 'what is your Sadhalp?' 'It is true,' said Eorann, 'and she is inside,' said she. 'It is not a lie,' said Suibhne, 'for no one has given me the power to go into the house of the king.' 'To me,' said the woman, 'no harm was done to your mind from every word that came from you and from what you did not like in her.' She said: 'Do not be angry with her, for she is a good woman who has been married to a man named Oilill Cédach, king of Ua Fhaoláin, who was good according to your sight.' Then Suibhne said: 'This is true,' said he, 'as the woman is from the side of the men after those words. Once I had a good opinion of her from the house of the man, for she gave me a gift of a cow and a bull, and if it was not in my power to go into Oilill Cédach's house, king of Ua Fhaoláin, then it would have been good according to your sight.' Then Suibhne said: 'This is true,' said he, 'as the woman is from the side of the men after those words.

Then Suibhne said: 'This is true,' said he, 'as the woman is","Afterwards Suibhne went into the house where Eorann was, and he found Eorann in the kitchen with a pot of broth. He said to her: 'Sadhalp, this is your part,' said he, 'what is the value of this?' 'It is true,' said Eorann, 'and it is inside,' said she. 'No, it is not,' said Suibhne, 'for nothing was taken from the crowd in the house.' 'To me,' said the woman, 'nor did you have any concern for each day that passed since you arrived, nor do you love your own people?' said she, 'give them a place and no hardship between us, for it is not our sight that has been harmed by this matter to those who have been wronged.' 'This is false,' said Suibhne, 'as the good of the land was given to women after these words. Once I had a good intention towards women, so that I gave them the support and care of a man's hand, for it was not your sight that has been harmed by this matter to those who have been wronged.' Then Suibhne said: 'Truagh éimh sin,' air Suiblme, 'as mairg dobheir taobh re mnáoi tar éis na mbriathar sin. Uair ba maith mo chummaoin-si ar an mnáoi romfúagrann samhlaidh, dóigh tucus inn-aonló dhí trí chaoga bó & caoga each, & dá madh é an lá romharbhus Oilill Cédach, rí Ua fFhaoláin, robadh maith lé mh'fhaicsin-si'; gonadh ann adbert annso síos","Afterwards, Suibhne went to Eorann and said to her that he had a matter which was to be discussed before the king regarding the banishment, and he said thus: 'Sadhalp. This is, O Eorann,' said he, 'what is the cause of your Sadhalp.' 'It is true,' said Eorann, 'and she is within,' said she. 'I do not know,' said Suibhne, 'as to that which was not in the company of the host.' 'To me,' said the woman, 'no one has shown you the cause for every day that you have been here and what you do not love from your soul,' said she, 'to make known and not to be angry with each other between you, for it is not our will that your sight be in the house of this matter for those who had caused a dispute.' 'This is false,' said Suibhne, 'as a result of the bad things which were said before her. Once upon a time my mind was good towards the woman from whom I was taken, and thus it was not by strength that I made one day with three cows and one ox, and if it were not for the day when we had our meeting with Oilill Cédach, King of Ua Fhaoláin, who had been well to my sight'; so in this way she said:"

'Threefold is the wound upon him,' said she, 'and the spear has been broken by the shield.' 'Flee!' said Cú Chulainn. And they fled from the battle. It was a great slaughter there, with Cú Chulainn and Scáthach in the rear and in the front and in the middle, and each one of them was wounded in their own place, every man in his own place, according to their own strength, and he said: 'Foe, you who are a warrior!' &c.

On the occasion of the making of this, they made a truce.

They made a truce, that is, they laid down their arms, for the sake of Cú Chulainn and the agreement between them, and they set aside their quarrel and their strife so that they would not fight against each other in battle, nor against the army which was in the battle. On account of this, they made a peace with each other. They were given a truce for the sake of Cú Chulainn, as a result of the agreement; because he had been wounded in battle and had not been able to fight against them, there was a great pity upon him at that time","There was a battle for Scáthach, which was not at the time of the spring when the armies were gathered; and it is said that the woman Aífe was the mother of Scáthach Cú Chulainn and of the swift one. The warriors were set in array before them to be given in the battle, according to law (i.e., the composition) relating to Scáthach Cú Chulainn and to the casting away of the shield and to the breaking of two swords in the hand from the time of the battle, on the shields which are not for the men. On account of the command given them was their deed. They were greatly exalted by the wisdom of Cú Chulainn, as they had been before the warrior; since their own was a great power to fight with in the time of the battle, so was it a great glory to be in that place"

They went together on a third of the army of Aiffi. Across the army they were going with a third of the men from Aiffi. There was a great number of the people in the battle, and they had not been previously trained or tested in any way. They (the sons of Scathqu) were in the battle of Arnau-haruch and in the war for Aiffi; and from the three sons of Esse, Enchinné and Cirí and Birí, three men from Aiffi went with them. They went to the place of the great host of the two sons of Scathqu. There was a very large number of the people in this place, who had not been previously trained or tested in any way. The son of Scathach, the daughter of És, was at the head of those who were untrained and untested; neither had they any knowledge nor love for anything else. All that was on the bad side was the weakness in the middle of the battle. Aill (the son) was the one who would have been the cause of a great weakness in the middle of the host of Scathce, if it were not that the two sons of Scathce had been given to Aiffi by a good man and they would have been given to him in a good time. Loegha, the son of Cu Chulainn, had two sons for whom the battle was prepared, and he did not let them go to war with his (own) men and those who were untrained and untested; nor would he have done so with the host of the three of them"

The man who was chosen for the king and for every man on the day of battle. Cu Culaind went to the assembly of the men and spoke with the girl's voice. 'I will not be a slave to you,' said Ruad, 'and I will not be in your service.' 'No,' said Cu Chulaind. 'I will go from this land to the land of Érinn until the time comes when the people will be gathered together","There was a girl in the stronghold, and her father gave her a fair portion of land. There was Cu Culaind in the stronghold, and he had a great number of warriors. The men of the plain came to Conall and Lægairi. They made a truce with the king and with every man who would be there. Cu Culaind went to the two assemblies, and he gave the girl a fair portion of land. 'I will not give you the girl,' said Ruad, 'and I will not let her go from me.' 'Not so,' said Cu Chulaind. 'I will take the girl with me to Éirinn until the time comes when I can bring her back safely.'","There was a girl in the dunad, and the father of her gave her to the king's son for a wife. There came Cu Culaind from the dunad with a great company of men. The warriors were ready for battle against Conoll and Lægairi. A terrible slaughter was made there in the dunad as a reward for the Fomorians, but no one believed that girl to be their own daughter. Great sorrow was brought upon the king and on every man who had been present there. Cu Culaind went to the assembly of men and spoke loudly about the girl's knowledge of the truth. 'I will take this girl from you,' said Ruad, 'and I will do justice for myself.' 'Not so,' said Cu Chulaind. 'I will go on with the year as a man from the west until I have made peace with him"

O, if you would put your hand upon the sword, then Tanic went to the hill of Forcaill for the purpose of the meeting of Emiri. A full year was spent on the plain of the people and no one was able to reach the edge of the wood of the wild boar. The head of the year was turned back. 'This is now,' said Læig, 'the time when the daughter of Ruaid will be divided from her father, but not for the sake of the son who is born in the same way as the other.' Tair riunn tra', said he, 'by the edge of the land","Tanic Cu Chulainn with Eamain iartain & at-fed scelai ann. O ro cuir a scis n-de, tanic reme co dunad Forcaill do cuingid Emiri.

And from there he took a dark-hued horse, and thus he went to Forcaill with a view to pursuing Emir. The year was full of fine weather and no one had ever seen a more beautiful or better-favoured man than Eamain. Then the head of the year came. 'This is the truth, O Líag, that you have not been in a way to be at ease with Ruaid's ingenuity, but no one has ever given a better gift than the strength of your own body.' Then Tair said, 'By the right of the land"
"Oh, by the gods of battle, to the hero of Loch Cuan, may your enemies be broken and your foes cast into the sea! To Cu Chulainn's stone, which was struck in the battle, and to the blood of the warriors. The man who had been wounded in the fight, after the battle with the woman, said: 'O, by the gods of war, Cu Chulainn!' she said. 'This is a great wound that you have received.' Cu Chulainn sat on the stone, and the blood flowed from his wounds. 'I will not be afraid of your strength,' said Cu Chulainn, 'but I will fight against your spirit.' To Lugaid Reondercc, he said: 'And this is the reason for my sorrow.' And thus was the tale told","Oh, by the gods of battle, to the hero of Loch Cuan, may your enemies be broken and your foes cast into the sea! To the warrior Cu Chulainn, I give a stone from the mountain, and you shall not be harmed by the men of the east. The man who was in the chariot, after he had been wounded by the spear of the woman, cried out: 'O, cruel is the deed done to me, O Cu Chulainn!' she said. 'It is a great sorrow that I have caused you.' Cu Chulainn sat on the stone, and his blood flowed from his wounds. 'I will not be harmed by your deceit,' said Cu Chulainn, 'for I am not afraid of your fury.' To Lugaid Reondercc he spoke: 'And this is the truth.' And so was the matter settled","Oh, by the gods of battle, to the hero of Loch Cuan, I will not be a coward in the face of death. To the son of Cu Chulainn, the stone is in your hand, the shield and the spear of the warriors. The man of the red cloak was in the middle of the battle, the fire of the enemy's spears. Oh, by the gods of battle, it is not the time for a coward to run from the fight. Is this what you have done? Derbforcaill daughter of Rvaid and her mother. 'Wicked is your deed, O Cu Chulainn!' she said. 'It is not the way of warriors to flee from battle.' Then Cu Chulainn stood upon the stone, with his shield in front of him. 'I will not be a coward in this fight,' said Cu Chulainn, 'for I have seen your blood.' To the son of Lugaid Reondercc, and the warrior's oath was made. And so ended the tale","Oh, by the god of battle, to the warrior of Lake Quan, since you have been slain by two men for a certain reason. To the son of Cu Chulainn, the stone is in this place, and not the blood of the people. The man who was bound with ropes and thrown into the sea. Oh, by the god of the gods, it is the one who is bound, by the binding of the god's strength. It was there that Derbforcaill daughter of Rvaid and her sister were. 'Wicked is your hand, O Cu Chulainn!' she said. 'It is a wound which I have made for you.' Then Cu Chulainn struck the stone with his sword in a great rage. 'I do not make peace with you who are dead,' said Cu Chulainn, 'the blood of your people is on me.' To the king of the men of Cenai, to Lugaid Reondercc. And this is the tale told"
"And by Cu Chulainn, the year of the battle of the ford of Forcaill was not long in the time of the daughter of the king of the Laoghaire, and the son of the king of the Laoghaire did not go with him to the battle. Thus Cu Chulainn was a companion to Luglochtaib Loga for the battle of Forcaill, and the battle was in the place where the sons of the king of the Laoghaire were, and the son of the king of the Laoghaire was not with him at the battle. And it was a great battle, that is, the battle of Cu Chulainn against three hundred and nonbair, and from the side of the king of the Laoghaire came to the battle of Cu Chulainn, and it was a great battle, that is, the battle of Cu Chulainn against three hundred and nonbair, and from the side of the king of the Laoghaire came to the battle of Cu Chulainn","And by the boy Cu Chulainn, the year of the battle of the ford of Forcaill was not made known to the daughter of the king until the day of the meeting of the two armies. Then Cu Chulainn went to Luglochtaib Logha to the ford of Forgaill and the battle was decided in the combat of the two armies on that day and the boy was wounded greatly, i.e., the boy's hand was broken three times and not once, and from that time onward the boy Cu Chulainn was not able to go into the combat of the two armies again, and it is a great sorrow upon him in the battle of the two armies","And by the side of Cú Chulainn was the year of the battle of Dún Forcaill and not the daughter of the king was in the company of the men of the host. Thus did Cú Chulainn go to Lugaid's sons, the sons of Loga, to Dún Forgaill and the battle was fought on the plain before that place and the battle was a great one, i.e., the battle of Cét & Nonbair and the men of the host were in the plain before that place for Cú Chulainn and it was a great slaughter there, and it was not at all in the company of the men of the host but in the company of the sons of Lugaid and the battle was a great one. And it was from the beginning of the battle that the men of the host were in the plain before that place for Cú Chulainn and it was not in the company of the men of the host but in the company of the sons of Lugaid","And by the hand of Cú Chulainn, the year was made ready for the battle of Forcaill and not a single one of the warriors' sons was in the army with their company. Thus did Cú Chulainn beget from Loga to Forcaill and the tale was told of the slaughter of the men of that time and the retreat was made swift and strong, i.e., the army of Cú Chulainn, three hundred and no more, and upon the plain in front of the army of Forcaill, and it was a great assembly of warriors, their weapons were set on the ground, neither on the plain nor on their ships which they had at the beginning"

"What is the reason that the troop of Cú Chulainn, hundred warriors before each ford from Ath Scenmenn to Ollbinn to Boind m-Breg and to the assembly of the women, was not in the army and the men were safe afterwards? After the battle of Emvin Macha, the man of the host said thus: 'Atnagar Eimear is in Cræbruaidh Concopuir with the good of Ulster and the warriors of the host.' A warrior from Dá gDottengai to Ulster, that is Bricne Nemtengai son of Carbad. And now, as the poet said: 'Let it be a gift for you,' he said, 'from Cú Chulainn to you, to your men and to the woman's head in the feast at Concopar tonight, for it is less than the hundred women of Ulster in the assembly.' Then, if the man of Cú Chulainn was not there, then the assembly was closed and they did not go with the battle to the army from the ford in the east and the men went out from the assembly.","What is the truth of the tale that Cú Chulainn, a hundred men before every ford from Ath Scenmenn to Ollbine to Boind m-Breg and all the assemblies of the women of that place, and the young men and the old men, and the peace, and the tidings of the people? After the departure of Emvin Macha, the daughter of the king of the land, from the house of the king. Atnagar Eimear is in Cræbruaidh Concopuir with the good of Ulster, and the warriors are ready for battle. A man from Dá gDottengai to Ulster, that is Bricne Nemtengai son of Carbad. And now, as he was speaking, he said: 'It is a matter of truth,' said he, 'that in the company of Cú Chulainn there are those who will not be able to go with you on the night and the woman's child from the feast at Concopar tonight, for it is less than the hundred women of Ulster in their assembly.' And if the company of Cú Chulainn was not present then, and if he had not been there, they would have gone forth to battle with the men of the army for the sake of the people, and they would have gone out from the place of gathering.","What is the truce which Cú Chulainn made with a hundred men from every ford of Ath Scenmenn to Ollbín to Boind m-Breg and to all the assemblies of those who had been in the ingenuity and tidiness? After that, I will tell you about Emvin Macha's son, the one who was in the adharc. Atnagar Eimear is in Cræbruaidh Concopuir with the good of Ulster and the men of the fair. A man from the two tribes went to Ulster, i.e., Bricne Nemtengai son of Carbad. And thus it was said: 'Let your daughter be given,' he said, 'to Cú Chulainn for a hundred women and a good woman for a feast with Concopar tonight, for it is less than the hundred of the women of Ulster in the assembly.' Then, if Cú Chulainn was not present at that time and did not go to the assembly, then he would be defeated by the strength of his shoulder against the force of the army in the morning and the tidiness of the men.","What did the warrior find after the battle of CnCulaind, hundred men for each path from AthScenmenn to Ollbinn to Boind m-Breg and the gathering of the women in the womb & the tear of the body & the skin of them? After that came Emvin Machai with a man in the house. Atnagar Eimeur is in Cræbruaidh Concopuir with the goodwill of Ulad, and men from the army for the victory. A man from Dvaig, to Ulltaib asstoig, i.e., Bricne Nemtengai son of Carbad. Conad and ispert side: 'Let the gift be to them,' said he, 'the skin of Coin Culaind to you, and let the men of the people be to you at night & the woman's head in a good time for the feast in Concopar at night, for it is less than the hundred women of Ulad's kingdom.' Then, if I had been with Coin Culaind then, and if I had been with the gathering of the women from the womb & the skin of them to be on the outside with the hand of the people for the battle in the morning & the skin of them out with the longswords"
"It is not the great Cú Chulainn who is in danger, said Cathbad, but rather the king of the men of Bricne, whom I have not yet named. It was Cú Chulainn who was in the middle of the battle, said he. 'Let Cú Chulainn be slain!' said Conchobar, 'and let the great and terrible slaughter of his brothers be done.' Then Cú Chulainn turned back. 'I will not flee,' said he, 'but I will go to the place where the men of the Fiada are gathered.' Then Cú Chulainn went on, and was not delayed by any of them, nor by their weapons, nor by their spears, nor by their shields, nor by their armor, nor by their swords, nor by their arrows. And he did not allow his wounds to be treated with the healing herbs of Sleip Fvaid, nor did he allow his wounds to be bound with bandages or with oil from the Fiada. Then they came upon Cú Chulainn and were not able to delay him, nor to stop him from going forward into battle against the men of Emna","It is a great sorrow and, said Cathbad, 'but by the curse of the king of the men of Bricne I will not do it to you. It was Cu Chulainn who was in the place of the woman's portion,' said he. 'Let Cu Chulainn be slain!' said Conchobar, 'and let the man of the red fire go to his brother.' Then Cu Chulainn turned back. 'I will not be killed,' said he, 'and I will send a swift horse to Sleip Fvaid.' Then Cu Chulainn went on and was not in fear of him with regard to the cows or the oxen or the sheep or the goats or the pigs or the fowls or the birds or the dogs or the cats or the hounds, but he was in fear of the men of Emna. Then they came upon Cu Chulainn and were not in fear of him with regard to the cows or the oxen or the sheep or the goats or the pigs or the fowls or the birds or the dogs or the cats or the hounds, but he was in fear of the men of Emna. Then they came upon Cu Chulainn and were not in fear of him with regard to the cows or the oxen or the sheep or the goats or the pigs or the fowls or the birds or the dogs or the cats or the hounds, but he was in fear of the men of Emna","It is not easy to go on, said Cethfad, but there is a taboo against the king of the men of Bricne, from whom I have taken it. It was Cu Chulainn who was in the middle of the battle with the women, said he. 'Let Cu Chulainn be slain!' said Conchobar, 'and let the slaughter of the army be made for his brother.' Then Cu Chulainn turned back. 'I am wounded,' said he, and he sent a message to Evlma of Faili with Sleip Fvaid. Then Cu Chulainn turned back and was not able to fight him in his own strength against the men and women and against all the warriors and against the great army from Sleip Fvaid, nor did he give a blow to his enemies with the might of faith of the Emno. Then they came upon him who had been wounded, and they set out for Cu Chulainn","It is not long since, said Cethfad, 'but it was a taboo to the king of the men of Bricne that I should not have been given. Cu Chulainn was in the presence of the queen of the land,' said he. 'Let Cu Chulainn be slain!' said Conchobar, 'and let the slaughter of the red-haired one's brother be made.' Then Cu Chulainn turned back. 'I will go forth,' said he, 'and I will bring to you a reward from the host of Slep Fvaid.' Then Cu Chulainn went forth and did not suffer the blow of the man before him nor of his kinsmen nor of his warriors nor of any of them who were in Sleip Fvaid nor did he give a share of the spoils to the men of Emna. The men of the host pursued Cu Chulainn, and they fell upon him with their spears and with their shields and with their axes, and all the good weapons of the world were broken in Sleip Fvaid, and no one could take from him a single drop of blood to be given to the men of Emna. The men who had been following Cu Chulainn turned back and they fell upon him from every side"
"By the warrior of the Ulster, I have been cast in my own time into the fire. It is a great and noble company that was assembled: Emer to the feast of Concobar the old, and Fercus and Cathbad to the assembly of the men of Con Culaind and Bennocht Vlad upon the plain of their battle. From this, I will go forth and be a warrior of the host. Conchubar will be the judge of Emire's judgment. By the word of the man of Con Culaind and by the law of his kinship, and not a single man will be left in the land to oppose him","By the warrior, I was carried in Ulster from my own country to the old fort. It is a great and noble company of men: Emer, daughter of Conchobar the old, and Fercus and Cathbad, their sons, who were born to be companions of Cú Chulainn and the son of Lóraíng, who was born in the land of Ulster. From that time on, and by the warrior's hand, I was brought up. Conchobar examined Emire's side with a sharp sword. By the word of the poet, I was given to Cú Chulainn and the son of Lóraíng, and the son of Lóraíng took me from my mother's arms. From that time on, and by the warrior's hand, I was brought up","Of the warrior, I will relate to you in Ulster what I have heard from the old men. It is a tale of great wonder and strange things: Emer made a feast for Conchobar the mighty, and Fercus and Cathbad with their sons' companions came together on the plain of Con Culaind and went to war against the army of Laith. Then, after that, they were both slain; and Conchubar was in great sorrow over the death of Emer. The son of Conchubar, Cú Chulainn, took up arms and went forth to battle. He fought with the men of Ulster, and he killed many warriors who came against him from the north","For the warrior of the army, I shall fight in Ulster with my own hand; it is a noble deed to compare with: Emer made a feast for Conchobar at the time of the gathering of the men of Ulster and Fercus and Cathbad on account of their skill in battle with Con Cullaind and Bennocht Vlaid on the plain of their valor. From that time onward, and for the warrior of the army, I shall be a companion; Conchobar examined Emir's spear, and he saw its sharpness. For the battle of the men of Ulster and Fercus and Cathbad on account of their skill in battle with Con Cullaind and Bennocht Vlaid on the plain of their valor"

"There was a great gathering of the people of Glendalough to the church of Clonmacnoise, and the clergy of Termonkelly and Termonbohan. They went in the evening for a meeting of the clergy, and they spent beer and wine that night. The priest went to the church. It was the custom in that church that Fáelgen gave to the people of Brughagh mac Deagaidh and the great assembly of the clergy that night, which was very much against Suibhne's great pride of that night and the advertisement: 'Truagh ám,' said he, 'not from Muirghe Rath, for the destruction of the house of nobility in this trouble'; so the priest there made a decree to be let go","There was a great gathering of the people of Glendaloch towards the west, in the place where the church of Cloncille is situated, and the meeting-place of Terenagh and Terenaghe. They went to the east for the purpose of the assembly of the clergy, who had been accustomed to drink wine and water during that night. The priest was going from the church. It was a great sorrow in that church for Fáibhlen towards the people of Brughaih, son of Deaghaidh, and the great number of the clergy during that night, which were so numerous as to be a great burden upon Suibhne, and he said: 'Trúath ámha,' said he, 'not from the side of Muigh Rath, for the destruction of the people in the trouble-situation'; thus the priest was going from the church, and the people were going down.","There was a great lament in the Glen of Bolcaim for the death of Cluain Cilli, the son of Teren and Teren Bogue. They made a solemn vow before the assembly of the nobles that they would not drink beer or wine on that night. Then they went to the church. It was from this church that Faelbhan came to the people of Brughaigh mac Deagaidh, and there was a great gathering of druids on that night, which caused great sorrow for Suibhne, and he said: 'Truagh amh,' said he, 'not by the Muir Rath from my house, the nobleman, in this trouble,'; thus the priest there made them go out with a decree.","There was a great gathering in the house of Glinn Bolcaín towards the end of the day when they were occupied with the festival of Cluain Cilli, and the singing of the song of Tíre Conaill & Tíre Bóghaine. After that came a solemn assembly for the purpose of composing a poem which they had not finished in that night. They went after that to the hill of Cluain. It was the custom in that place for Fáibhlen to be brought before the people of Brughaigh mic Deaghaidh, and also for the great druid to be present at that night's gathering, so that he might be addressed by Suibhne with great reverence for the night and for the gathering itself, and the poet said: 'Trúagh ámh,' he said, 'not from Muigh Rath, but from the place of respite in the noble house of the king,'; and thus was the laudable song set down to be sung."
"Suibhne was surrounded by the people of the church at Snámh for Sionainn, and the good of Cluain Boirenn in that time; the old men who had been in the assembly were there. In that place afterwards, the clerics of the church were making a noise about the lordship of the nones and women, with a line and a ben, with a brat of linen. 'It is not right to be silent,' said Suibhne, 'for the women of old age in the Coimdedh for the milled.' 'Flee from the ben of the line,' said he, 'in order that my people may be safe in the battle at Maigh Rath.' The son afterwards was surrounded by the bell of the esparta about his head, and a sign: 'It is good to me to be silent,' said he, 'the voice of the hounds for the church on the edge of Banna for each leath in the inas grig-gráig of the hearing of them atchluinim the night,' with the laidh:","Suibhne was watching from behind the hill when Snámh, two sons of Sionainn, came to Cluain Boirenn with a good and strong army; the old men were greatly afraid of the battle. In that place afterwards, the clerics of the church were in great fear because of the noise of the women and the crying of children. 'It is not right,' said Suibhne, 'to be angry at the women of the old age of Coimdedh for their sons.' 'Let the woman go,' he said, 'and let her take the child with her from that place where I was in battle at Maigh Rath.' Then afterwards, the son of Sionainn went to the bell of the church and cried out: 'It was good for me to be angry,' said he, 'the voice of the birds on the branch of Banna for every leaf in the green and red of the ear of the corn, until the night,' with the laud:","Suibhne spoke to those around him, saying that the child of Snámh and Én for Sionainn was not a son of Cluain Boirenn, nor was he born in the place where the old men had been on the day of the battle. And from there came a man who was the chief of the house, who went to the river and took the woman with him, and they were going along the line and the ben, and Suibhne said: 'It is not right for you to go,' he said, 'to the old women of Coimdedh for your milled. Let the woman be given a place in the line,' he said, 'instead of my people in the battle of Maigh Rath.' Then a man from the south came with a bell and a spade, and this was the warning: 'It is good for me to go,' he said, 'the voice of the birds on the branch of Banna for every one of the grey-haired men who are in the listening of the cluig si atchluinim tonight,' according to the law","Suibhne was with the men of the Church at Snámh for Sionainn, in the district of Cluain Boirenn as far as the tan; and the young men who were in the training of the clergy there. In that place afterwards, a certain number of clerics of the church were present, giving to the youth and to women, a line & ben (i.e., a staff & a robe), with a blessing. 'It is not fitting for me,' said Suibhne, 'that the aged woman of Coimdedh be made a nun.' 'Depart from the ben of the lion,' said he, 'in return for this injury to my household in the battle of Maigh Rath.' The sion (i.e., the council) afterwards was with the cloths of the esparta as a gift; and the herald: 'It is very good for me to have this,' said he, 'the voice of the fowls over the ruins of Banna for each day in the month of Grig-Gráig, since the hearing of the church at night,' co n-ébert an laoidh"
