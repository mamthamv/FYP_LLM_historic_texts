'Good,' said the woman, 'my assembly is here tonight. But there are three warriors on the road and not one of them will be able to reach the ford tonight, but they will be slain by their own good fortune. You shall carry my entire wealth to that warrior and say it is he who was here and lived in the house and died in the house, and she fell in a peaceful sleep"

"Then the woman said to Reimpi, 'To Colman of the wanderers: have you heard the news? You are the only one who has seen the face of the man.' 'I am a wanderer,' he said, 'and I will not be silent about it; every word that is spoken, I do not deny it.' 'It is my daughter,' she said, 'my son.' 'That is a sin,' said Colman, 'and it should be punished by Aena","Then the woman said to Reimpi, 'To Colman of the wanderers: have you heard the news? I am your true companion in need.'

The youth spoke about that to Colman, saying: 'Take the portion for Aena,' said Colman","It was true, that a young man killed the people of Cluana and Ech Aena, so they came out from their fort. The young man took from Ech Aena a hundred cows to the young man in Níc Eich. Then the young man went with Colmán to get them. 'Take the plunder for Aena,' said Colmán"
"The poet recited a verse to Aena, and took the stanza: 'A son of Laígse was great in the head over the hundred cows; the great one to go to the heifer in the fair of the cattle.'

"He was, indeed, wounded by Oengus in the battle of Aithechdai and was carried to his tent by men who bore him away from the battlefield. (It was not Dubcrón the servant of Oengus who was there at that time.) Then a man came forward and struck him with a spear on the eye and on the cheek, and the clan of Athechda took him to the place where they had their encampment (i.e., in the camp of Oengus) until he was three days dead. They then cut off his head and placed it upon a pole for his red hair and his mantle over his head. Dubcrón was then brought before Dubglais, i.e., before his master. 'A beggar, Dubcrón,' said he. 'Not so,' said Dubcrón. 'What of Oengus?' 'He is in the battle; sit, sit,' said they, 'for no one will take him. A beggar and a beggar is this house.' 'I will not take his battle unless it be given to me by right. Take the mantle from him,' said he. It was taken. 'Truth, Oengus,' said he. And he said: 'A debt of blood is due to him for the wound; let the hand of the man who struck Oengus be cut off","He was, indeed, wounded by Oengus in the battle of Aithechdai and was carried to his men for burial. (It was not Dubcrón the servant of Oengus who was there at that time.) Then a man took up his shield and spear, and struck him in the eyes and in the face and in the head of Athechda so that they would be buried in (i.e., in the mound of Oengus) until three men would bury him. They cut off his head afterwards and carried it away for his red hair and for his mantle over his head. Dubcrón was brought before Dubglais, i.e., before his master. 'A servant,' said he. 'Not so,' said Dubcrón. 'Who is Oengus?' 'He is in the battle; sit, sit,' said they, 'for no one would take him. A servant and a servant of this house.' 'I will not take his battle except if it be given to me by my lord. Take the mantle from him,' said he. He took it. 'Truth, O Oengus,' said he. And he said: 'A gift for you is the mantle which was taken from the head of Oengus","He was fighting, and Óengus was in the battle of Aithechdai, and he was struck by a spear through his side, so that he died. (It was not Dubcrón the servant of Óengus who was there at that time.) Then a man took up a sharp grey sword, and cut out his eyes and his tongue, and the people of Aithechda carried him forth to be buried in (i.e., in the church of Óengus) until three days had passed over him. Then they struck off his head, and they gave it to his red hair and his mantle for his head. Dubcrón took up the sword, i.e., his own sword. 'A spear, O Dubcrón,' said he. 'No,' said Dubcrón. 'What is Óengus?' 'He is in the grave; sit, sit, on whatever you have not taken. A spear and a spear here in the house.' 'I will not take his grave unless it be given to me by right. Take the mantle from his body,' said he. He took it. 'Truth, O Óengus,' said he. And he said: 'A deadly wound for him who has taken the mantle of the man; a wound under the hand in the head of Óengus","It was there that Óengus was killed by the men of Aithechdai, and it was not by his own people that he was slain. (It was not Dubchrón the servant of Óengus who did it at that time.) Then a man from the house of Díb took a grey spear and struck him in the eye and in the face and pierced the head of Aithechdai, so that three men were killed by the same spear. They afterwards severed his head and bore it forth for his red hair and for the covering of his head. Dubchrón was then slain for Dubglais (i.e., for his own taking). 'Turn back, Dubcrón,' said he. 'Not I,' said Dubcrón. 'What is Óengus?' 'He is in the battle; sit, sit,' said they, 'do not look to him. Turn back and go to your house.' 'I will not look to his battle unless it be a good cause. Take this covering from me,' said he. He took it. 'Truth, Óengus,' said he. And he said: 'The spear that went through the eye of Óengus was a white one; it is fit for the head of Óengus.'"
