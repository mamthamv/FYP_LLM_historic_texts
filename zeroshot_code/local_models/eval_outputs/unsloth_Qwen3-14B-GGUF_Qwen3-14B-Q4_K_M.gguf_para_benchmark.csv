"There was a great tumult in the court of Suibhne, and Moling greatly resented the clearings made by each man as a single fray, and stones were thrown at every man in the court of Suibhne. 'Indeed, this is the man who is the cause of this fray,' said Moling, 'we have been harmed in that we were not safe from the conversation about the ownership of this plain. It was pleasant for me to see Suibhne, i.e., that he is the cause of this fray on that hill, i.e., the hill called Gealta, because it is certain that no one has ever seen a god or a demon or any other being who is in charge of that hill. Indeed, every other sign or omen is not fitting for Suibhne'; then Moling said thus","There was a great tumult in the court of Suibhne, and Moling greatly resented the clearings as if they were one fray, and stones were cast at every man in the court of Suibhne. 'Indeed, this is the man's teaching,' said Moling, 'we have been accustomed to be safe from the disturbance of the company of such a man. It was pleasant for me to see Suibhne, that is, this teaching which is in that book beyond, that is, the Book of the Book of Gealta, its name, for indeed it is not known what is said and what is not said by the god who spoke and the gods who heard and the angels who are before him. Indeed, every other teaching is not worth a single word compared to Suibhne'; thus Moling concluded","There was a great lament for Suibhne, and Moling greatly resented the clearings as though they were one fire, and stones were thrown at every man in Suibhne's teaching. 'Indeed, this man is a teacher,' said Moling, 'we would have been safe if we had not been discussing the matter of the foxes of this district. It was pleasant for me to see Suibhne, that is, this teacher himself, at that time, that is, Tiupra Tioprat§na Gealta by name, although it is a notable thing that the word 'diabolical' is applied to him and to his wisdom and his deeds which are most unbecoming of the tioprat. Indeed, every other teaching or teaching not related to Suibhne'; then Moling said in conclusion","It is said that the poet Táinic composed a poem for Suibhne, and Moling greatly delighted in it as if it were a single frisbee, and every man was struck by it in the teaching of Suibhne. 'This is indeed the man's teaching,' said Moling, 'for we were once safe and sound when discussing the matter of this particular passage. It was pleasant for me to see Suibhne, that is, this teaching itself from that passage beyond, namely Tiupra Tioprat§na Gealta by name, because it is indeed known that the word 'notoimhledh' is said and the days are passed and the good things are with him who commands the passage. The knowledge of every other teaching or not teaching is indeed Suibhne'; then Moling concluded"
"The youth said that he was a sinner. 'Because of the deed of sinning, O youth,' said Suibhne, 'that is my punishment without mercy, for I will not be able to celebrate a feast under the shadow of the axe which was given to me by the sons of the sinners.' 'If you wish to go there,' said the youth, 'I would not have been able to escape even if it were great to me to be hidden.' 'By Christ, O man,' he said, 'the punishment of your sin is not on any one of them who was in the company of a woman, but because of the will of God I was afflicted with this death here and I received a small portion of the milk from the breast of the woman who was wronged, and I would not have been able to obtain anything from the side of the woman, even though it were on the land of the sinners.' 'Christ's mercy upon you, O youth,' said Moling, 'because of the evil deed of sinning, a great sorrow is upon you henceforth and a separation from the deed of sinning.' 'There is no strength in your words,' said Suibhne, 'for they will be burned in the east and I will be killed for the sin of the sinners.' 'A reward of justice upon you,' said Moling, 'that is, a company of companionship from me to you,' and he gave them the laity in three: that is, Suibhne, Mongán and Moling","The youth said that he was wounded. 'Because of the act of vengeance, young man,' said Suibhne, 'that is my maiming without any delay, for I will not allow a feast to be held under the shadow of the axe which was given to me by the sons of the warriors.' 'If you wish to go forth,' said the youth, 'you would not find it easy even though it is great to me to have a difficult journey.' 'By Christ, young man,' he said, 'the aimlessness of your soul is not like any other soul that I have seen on this earth. From the will of God I was brought up and I would be a small thing in your eyes if you were to kill me here and take a little from the milk of the cows which are given by the women, and I would not accept anything from the side of the women against their will on the land of the warriors.' 'May Christ protect you, young man,' said Moling, 'because of the evil act of vengeance, a great sorrow is upon you and a long time will pass before the act of vengeance is done.' 'There is no strength in your words,' said Suibhne, 'for they are like the cold wind from the north and I shall be killed for the maiming of the warriors.' 'May the judgment of God come upon you,' said Moling, 'that is, a great sorrow upon me because of you,' and the three of them, that is Suibhne, Mongán and Moling, were judged by the law","The boy said that he was being pursued. 'Because of the act of theft, O boy,' said Suibhne, 'that is my marring without any delay, for I will not allow you to feast on the plunder of the goods which were stolen from the young men.' 'If you intend to go there,' said the boy, 'I would not have given it to you even if it was great to me in value.' 'By Christ, O man,' said he, 'the intent of your soul is not on any matter that I have seen in the soul of another man on my own land. From the will of God I was made and I would have given you a little of my life here, and take a little of your plunder from God from the women who were captured, and I would not have brought the side of the women with you to the land of the stolen goods.' 'Christ's mercy on you, O boy,' said Moling, 'from the evil of the act of theft, a great sorrow is upon you and a lasting punishment for the act of theft.' 'There is no good in your soul,' said Suibhne, 'for it is being heated by fire and will be killed for the plundering of goods.' 'A lawsuit against you there,' said Moling, 'that is, a legal claim from me for your injury,' and they made a judgment on the matter of the three: that is, Suibhne, Mongán and Moling","The boy spoke of the devil's deceit. 'Indeed, this is the work of the devil, my boy,' said Suibhne, 'that is, my marvellous tale without any falsehood, for I would not dare to feast on the flesh of the holy ones who were burned.' 'If you are so certain about it,' replied the boy, 'then it would be a great misfortune for me.' 'By Christ, my man,' said he, 'the devil's malice is not aimed at any single person, but at all people, as the devil himself says: 'I am the one who causes death in this place, and I will take your life here, and I will have a drink from the milk of the woman who was unchaste, and I will not be hindered by the side of women, for they are not worthy of the land of the holy ones.' 'Christ's mercy be upon you, my boy,' said Moling, 'from evil of the work of the devil, a marvellous gift to you, and a reward from the work of the devil.' 'There is no virtue in your speech,' said Suibhne, 'for there are many lies in it, and I shall be killed for the work of the devil.' 'I ask for peace for you,' said Moling, 'that is, I will not hinder you,' and they divided the life of the three, that is, Suibhne, Mongán, and Moling"
"There was a battle of Suibhne against the men of Connacht, and it happened under the sky of All Fharannáin's territory of Múaidhe; a glen of aloinn eisidhén, a stream of aloinn sriobhúaine, and a hill of tepersin§co tinnesnach frisin all aill§ below and above, with the people of the noble and faithful, and it was the same there. A tree of caomháloinn against the terrible destructive things in all hisin. It was the same there, the eye of eidheann true and aball cenntrom against the crooked ones who would bring destruction to the lands with their terrible deeds, it was a matter of nobility in that allt sin ois allta & míola muighe & muca mórthroma, it was the same there, the rook of roiremhar rochodladh there after coming from the great sea into that all. Suibhne's house was destroyed by the great wrath, so he took for adoption and gave his testimony before the people; thus spoke the poet","There was a battle of Suibhne against the men of Connacht, and it happened under the heavens of the world, in the land of All Fharannáin's Tír Fíachrach Mhúaidhe; a valley of sorrowful lamentation, a stream of sorrowful weeping, and writing of the scribes was there. And there were many noble men and chieftains who were slain by the sword, and it was they who were noble in that place. A tree of mourning was there with its branches broken from the violence of the battle; and it was there that the cry of the people was heard, and the wailing of women and the howling of great wolves, and it was there that the mighty warriors fell after coming from the great sea into that place. The house of Suibhne was destroyed by the great wrath, so that he took to flight and gave his testimony before the assembly; thus spoke the poet","At the time of Aroile, Suibhne was hunting in Connacht for a long while, and it happened under the sky of All Fharannáin's fertile land of Múaidhe; a glen of alpine heather, a stream of alpine water, a scribbled writing by the scribe, and a tinny bell ringing all around; below and above in the place where the ancient assembly of the holy and truthful was held, and it was there that the people of the same kind were gathered. It was there also that the branch of the gentle tree was cut from the roots of the terrible destructive trees within that land. It was there too that the true judgment and the central pillar were bent by the power of the lands which had great strength; it was no matter for the nobility in that place, or the people of the district and the big strong pigs, but it was there also that the numerous royal birds were flying about after coming from a great sea to that land. Suibhne's house was destroyed by such a great disaster, so he chose to take refuge and gave his trust to the hill; thus spoke the poet","Aroile laithe do Suibhne at the time of cutting of the harvest in Connacht to the service of the high king, it happened under the order of High King Fearannán of Tír Fhiachrach Múaidhe; a valley of continual warfare, a stream of continual flow of writings and compositions, with many noble men and women who had been slain, and the nobles and chieftains were there in their assemblies of saints and warriors together. It was there that trees of mourning were planted for the great calamities which happened within it. It was there also that a numerous host of armed men came to the hill with weapons from the surrounding lands, and they brought forth great destruction; it was there also that the wild boars and wolves and big cattle were slain after coming from the large sea beyond that place. The house of Suibhne was broken down greatly by that disaster, so he took to seeking refuge and giving his protection to those in danger; thus spoke the poet"
"Suibhne was driven by the men of the town of Moling, that is, the house of Moling. It was his sin that he had been a psalmist of Caoimhin in the service of Moling, and he was giving food to the poor. Later Suibhne was driven by the company of the clerics and rogues who were eating bread. 'This early plundering, you villains,' said the cleric; then they went to the house of Moling and drove Suibhne from it","Suibhne was driven by the men of the town of Moling, that is, the house of Moling. It was then that the psalter of Caoimhin was in the possession of the people of the church. Later Suibhne was driven from the row of the towers in the churchyard and took to eating grass. 'This early plundering, my boys,' said the priest; then they went to Moling and drove Suibhne away from it","Suibhne was driven by the people of the town of Moling, that is, the house of Moling. It was his sin that he had been a psalmist of Caoimhgín in the service of Moling, and he gave praise to the attendants. Later Suibhne was driven by the assembly of the tithing in the service of the clerk and rogues were eating bread. 'Because of this early plunder, you villains,' said the clerk; then they went to advertize Moling and Suibhne answered them","Suibhne was driven out by the men of the district of Moling, that is, of Teach Moling. It was then that the psalter of Caoimhin was in the house of Moling, and they gave it to the people of the chapel. Later on Suibhne was driven from the row of the monks in the district of the clerics & he took to eating bread. 'Because of this early defeat, my sons,' said the cleric; then they went to the house of Moling & challenged Suibhne"
"As mochen éimh do thecht sonn, O Shuibhne,' said Moling, 'for which your song is here and your sorrow for the deed here, your tale and your wandering for their finding of the sun and their delay in the true religion, and they have found it fort,' said Moling, 'though great strife each day of Ireland's teaching every heresy to me towards a complete knowledge of the tale.'","As mochen éimh do thecht sonn, O Shuibhne,' said Moling, 'for which your song is here and your sorrow for the deed here, your tale and your wandering for their finding of the sun and their acceptance in the true religion, and they have found it fort,' said Moling, 'though great is the strife each day of Ireland's teaching every craft to me towards a complete knowledge of the tale.'","As much as I can, I will tell you, O Suibhne,' said Moling, 'the song that is in your mind to be here and your sorrow for the deed there, your tale and your wandering for your seeking and your hardship in the fire of the furnace, and this is the fort,' said Moling, 'though great is the strife each day that Ireland suffers from every kind of oppression against me to the end of my life","“It is your own fault that you are in this trouble, O Suibhne,” said Moling, “for it is your own doing to be here and your own neglect of the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom and the seeking out of truth and justice in the true religion, and they have seized upon you by force,” said Moling, “though every day I have been telling all of Ireland that I would not allow any heathen to remain under my roof.”"
"The death of the woman afterwards; it was in that year that Moling was engaged in teaching. He went on a day to Inis Bó Finni in the west of Connacht, a day to Ess Rocháoin Rúaidh, a day to Slíabh Mínáluinn Mis, a day to Benda Biothfhúara Boirche; and from those places he went every day without ceasing until the evening at Moling's house. Moling ordered a meal for himself that night, and he gave a portion of the milk of his cow to each of his attendants. The name of the woman was Muirghil, who was the wife of Mungan, the father of Moling. It was she who prepared the meal for him, namely, a dish made from the milk of the cow, with the fat of the udder and the skin of the hide in the mixture, and all the meat of it given to Suibhne. He gave it to him as a gift in the presence of his attendants and without any delay","The great slaughter of the foreigners afterwards; it was in that year that Moling was engaged in teaching. He went on a day to Inis Bó Finni in the west of Connacht, on a day to Ess rocháoin Rúaidh, on a day to Slíabh Mínáluinn Mis, on a day to Benda biothfhúara Boirche; and from those places he went every day without ceasing to his school at Moling. Moling ordered a great feast for himself that night, and he gave hospitality to the women of the cowherds who had given him their cows. The name of the woman was Muirghil, she was the wife of Mungán, the son of Moling. It was she who prepared the feast for him, namely, a dish of roasted meat with its fat and the whole of its marrow to Suibhne. He gave it to him in a very complete manner in the middle of the assembly of the people concerning that milk","The wounding of the cow in that time; it was the year when Moling was fasting. He went on a day to Inis Bó Finni in the west of Connacht, a day to Ess Rochaoin Ruidh, a day to Slíabh Mínáluinn Mis, a day to Benda Biobhfúara Boirche; and from those places he came every day without delay to the hostel of Moling. Moling ordered a meal for himself that night, and he gave a portion of milk from the cow which was given to him. The name of the cow was Muirghil, by which she was called by the men who fed Moling. It was this very cow that gave the milk of that meal, i.e., the milk which was taken from her udder in the enclosure and brought to the knowledge of Suibhne, and it was poured out entirely on the ground there for Suibhne. He took it with a full measure of fury in his heart against the man who had taken the milk","The wonder of the cow afterwards; it was with that year that Moling began to preach. He went a day in Inis Bó Finni in the western part of Connacht, a day in Ess Rochara Ruaidh, a day in Slíab Mínáluinn Mis, a day in Benda Biothfhuara Boirche; and from those [places] he would go every day without fail to his espousal every night until the house of Moling. Moling ordered that food be given to him for that year, and he would give a portion of the milk of the cows that were given to him. The name of the cow was Muirghil; she was the daughter of Mungan, the mother of Moling's son. It was this cow which gave birth to the woman, namely, a calf with white sides and black horns in the mating, as far as memory serves and the fullness of the milk there for Suibhne. He would be born from that as a very fine bull in the middle of the cattle of that herd"
"A woman of the household was seized by a sudden fear, and she cried out to another woman: 'I beg you,' said she, 'is it not better for you to have another man, and not to let your own husband be harmed in the battle that is coming upon you this year?' Then she turned her back on the household and went without saying anything more, and Muirghil saw her going at morning towards the ford of the river to go to Suibhne the generous, who was as strong as a bull. From the side of the household came a voice from within, and she said to her sister: 'The woman in that battle has given a man of the household, O my noble lady,' said she. The young man heard that speech, and he went quickly and took hold of his hand with a strong grip, and went forward before the battle. Soon after came the battle and its side towards him, and he was on foot throwing away his portion and the household. He gave the young man a blow from the side of his hand, which broke his leg below the knee against Suibhne, so that he could not go through the passage to the other side. The assembly of the men of the hill came upon the young man, where his strength was taken from him by the household, so that we saw him die","A woman of the household was seized by a sudden fear, and she cried out to another woman: 'I have no other man, nor is it fitting for you to take another man's place in ruling over this household which has been so greatly wronged by her during these years.' Then she turned from that household and went on foot to the hill of the black cow towards Suibhne the generous, who was very kind to the poor. From the hill of that household came a woman and spoke to her sister: 'The woman in that house has given another man's son, O daughter of the noble.' The servant heard this and went on foot with great speed and took hold of her half-hand which had been cut off inside the house and carried it away before the people. Immediately afterwards, the woman and her side were seized by fear and she was in the woods, throwing away her portion and the household goods. The servant threw a stone from his hand at her, which broke her leg below the knee towards Suibhne, so that he could not move along the road to her. Then came a company of men with a sharp knife and cut down the servant before him, where his body was taken away by the household goods, as we heard, and they obtained death","A storm arose at dawn upon the men of Muirghil and women of the household in the battle, and what was the matter with the other woman: 'I have not seen you before,' said she, 'is it not better for you to take another man and not let your own man be slain in the battle which is so high that it has been raised against them this year.' Then the woman turned her back upon that household and went forth, and Muirghil did not tell anyone what he saw when he went to the ford of the river towards Suibhne the generous of the battle who was very famous for his valor. From the side of that household came a man, and he addressed his sister: 'Your woman is in that slaughter, O my noble lady,' said he. The young man took up that speech, and went forth with great speed and struck his hand upon the left arm which had been wounded before and then went to the edge of the battle. Soon after came the wound and its side towards him and he was lying there, wasting away his portion and the battle. Then the young man cast a spear at the left arm from his hand, which broke the bone of his left hand against Suibhne, and he took the opportunity to run along the ridge over it. The people of the hill brought down a great number upon the young man, where his body was crushed by the battle, so that we had not expected death","There arose in the village of Eithir Muirghil and her women in the hall, so that another woman said: 'I have no love for you,' she said, 'nor would I give you a man else, nor would it be right for you to let your own man go to rule over the cattle which are being kept high by their yearly tribute from you.' Then she turned her back upon that hall and went, and never did Muirghil tell any one of what she saw when she went into the chamber of the cow to Suibhne the courteous, who was very cruel towards the cattle. From the chamber of that hall came a cry and she cried out to her brother: 'The woman in that death has given a man to the slaughter, O my kinsman,' she said. The boy heard that, and ran swiftly and took his hand from the half-brother who was inside the house and went towards the cattle. Immediately after, he had the cattle and their sides towards him. He drove the boy from the half-brother with the hand of his right, so that the boy's foot struck Suibhne's knee, and it was possible for them to pass over the broken ridge of the hill. The assembly made a decision concerning the head of the mountain, under which the boy would be buried, where his body would be taken from the cattle. So we have, at once, that the assembly got death"
"He was of two minds about him there, and he gave orders to his people to take possession of the land for them, and to name them. At that time Ronan interpreted its meaning for going to Suibhne, and being ready to go to the land of the other's people, as Ronan said: 'I have heard the high king of universal power that he did not allow that decree to be given to the knowledge of the assembly of the people of the kingdom, nor to the gathering of the men of the kingdom, nor to the giving of a gift or a reward to him for the battle, nor to the taking of the land by God's grace for his people, nor to be in danger or fear from him until the day of judgment, nor to be in sorrow or grief for him before the coming of the king, nor to be in pain or trouble for him after the death of the king, nor to be in any way against the people of the kingdom.'","He was of the two who were there, and he went to Rome at that time to bring a message to his people and to name them. Ronan interpreted at that time its meaning for going to Suibhne and being in the way of his land for the benefit of his people, saying: 'I have heard the high king universal powerful that he did not feed that injury to the knowledge of the old man of the holy one who was wounded, and the injury of the wound of battle on the side and the injury of the soul which God gave to his people nor let them be in fear or in danger from him until the day of their death, whether by fire or by sword, by the hand of the enemy after the end or by the loss for the Coimdeach not for his people beyond.'","There was a meeting of two factions there, and they went to the king of their territory to give him a choice regarding his people and to name them. Ronan made known at that time his intention to go to Suibhne and to be absent from his territory for the benefit of his people, saying: 'I have heard the high king who is all-powerful say that he would not allow that wrong-doing in the knowledge of the holy church, nor would he suffer the unjust man to strike a blow or cause injury to another, nor would he permit the teaching of God's word to be withheld from his people, nor would he allow them to be in danger or distressed by any means, whether through death or injury, through the loss of their soul from their body, on account of wrong-doing done to them after a judgment or decree not made for their people","There was a man of two sons in that place, and he gave to each son a portion of his land to possess with their people and with their names. At that time Ronan understood the meaning of going to Suibhne and being in the way of his land for the benefit of his people; thus said Ronan: 'I have heard the high king powerful, who did not feed that man of the knowledge of the fair dealing of the gods, of the right of battle, or the justice of God to his people, nor let him be plundered or wronged by any one against his soul from his body, on death or injury, on the guilt of the people or the unjust dealings of the men of the world after the day of the king's judgment, nor of the destruction of the people beyond them"
"God made the world in six days, and on the sixth day he created man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. And God said: 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.' So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them: 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.' And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day","God made the world in six days, and on the sixth day he created Suibhne from the flesh of Sléibe Fúaid, and he placed his foot there where he would be wounded by a spear there, that is, a wound of a spearhead of five points, sharp and pointed, without a body or a head, striking and leaping upon the smooth and slippery ground. Then they made a covenant between them and it was said: 'It is a wound,' said the first man. 'It is a wound of Ulster,' said the second man. 'A good spear,' said the third man. 'The spear is long,' said the fourth man. 'Not for battle,' said the fifth man. He gave his own life to him. They went forth, and every man of them was wounded and great was the valley before it, but not a wound was made upon the board from that side nor upon the hill from the other side","God gave it to Ronan, once upon a time when Suibhne came to the middle of Sléibe Fúaid and took his step there, so that he would be protected from injury there, namely the measure of a small horse's pace, seven paces without a collar & five paces of gaolwight, gairbhlíath, without a body, without a head etc., walking & leaping over the slippery place in front & behind. Once upon a time they were all together in conversation and it was said: 'It is a goat,' said the first man. 'It is an Ulster goat,' said the second man. 'A good horse,' said the third man. 'The long horse,' said the fourth man. 'Not a fair one,' said the fifth man. He gave his own fee to them. We went away from there, and every man of them was afterwards & their great company in the glen did not take notice of it, although it was placed on the board for them & for the people of the house before them","God preserved Ronan, once upon a time when Suibhne came to the mountain of Fuaid and took his step there so that he might not be harmed by any injury there, namely, a quantity of white-haired old men, seven without collars & five with collars, barefooted, without garments, etc., walking & leaping on the slippery slope backward & forward. Once upon a time they were all assembled together in conversation and this was their discourse: 'He is mad,' said the first man. 'He is Ulster mad,' said the second man. 'A good old man,' said the third man. 'The old man is long-winded,' said the fourth man. 'No longer for a while,' said the fifth man. Then his own people came to him, and they roared: 'Uime!' cried they, 'to every man of them without exception & great was the valley which did not accept it, but they were not inclined to the board without exception & to the men of the house for ever"
"It was a law of the old custom, that the grudge and the grievance, the wound and the injury, the blow and the beating of the head after them should be sought for and pursued. It was the trial and the judgment of that writing together with the kind of the two wrongs and the two injuries and the two wounds and the two bruises and the clots in the mouth, so that it would be a compensation to him and a fine of a bull's hide, which would be given for the injury of a man's eye, every man for his own, and all together for the breaking of trees and for the cutting of branches with iron and with fire, so that no one should have been able to go forth from it without having made peace with them","It was a law of the old custom, that the grudge and the grievance, the injury and the insult, the wound and the wounder of the head after them should be pursued and followed. It was the trial and the judgment of that writing together with the kindred of the two parties and their injuries and their losses and their wounds and their bruises, and to the clots in the mouth, so that it would be a matter of compensation and a payment of blood money for every man who had been wounded by another, and all men should be equal before the law and equally protected from the branches and from the heads of the rocks with their sharp edges, so that none of them would have to go to the court of the judge of the people","It was a law of the future that they should be greedy and grasping, deceitful and treacherous, cruel and merciless, as regards the heads after them who would seek to attack and to translate. It was the custom and habit of that writing that it should be connected with the kinds of their origins and their dangers and their lessons and their smoothness and their beauty, so that it should be pleasing to them and a sweetened drink for them, as they drank from the cup of the deep wisdom of every kind before them and all together in regard to the branches and the heads of the trees with leaves and long leaves, so that none of them was without knowledge of the new things which were made by the wise men of their own people","It is a law for ever upon wrath, to be greedy and covetous, deceitful and fraudulent, treacherous and seditious of the head after them who will strive and will write manifestos. It is the treason and the betrayal of that manifesto together with the kindred of their two kinships & two hostilities & two divisions & two slanders & their cloaks about the mouth, so that they should be adorned with peace and prosperity of a good harvest, taking from the root of a fruitful tree every kind for their own purpose & all together harmonious for the welfare of the branches & for the growth of the boughs with leaves, so that it was not asked of them to bring forth fruits of new law by a noble man of his own people & all together harmonious for the welfare of the branches & for the growth of the boughs with leaves, so that it was not asked of them to bring forth fruits of new law by a noble man of his own people & all harmonious for the welfare of the branches and the growth of the boughs with leaves, so that it was not asked of them to produce fruits of new law by a noble man of their own kindred & all together harmonious for the well-being of the branches and the growth of the boughs with leaves, so that it was not asked of them to bring forth fruits of new law by a noble man of their own people"
"It was a very dark night and the wind was howling through the woods and over the hills, and there was no light in the sky or on the earth at that time, for never before had such darkness been seen, nor ever again would it be seen, until the day when the sun rose from the west and the moon from the east. Great sorrow was there then; thus spoke the druid: 'A great evil has come upon us this night in the mourning of the slain and the heads on Slíabh Fúaid,' said he, 'but it is not right that I should be blamed for it, for I have always been just and upright.' Thus ended the tale","It was a great sorrow to them that the head of the king and the head of the queen were taken away by the men of the north, when they were in the middle of the plain. It was not known whether it was the king or the queen who was slain at that time, for neither of them was ever seen again after that, until one night came upon them in the top of the hill of Eneach, Aineach; and indeed it was very dark on that night when they were taken away from their beds. They made a great mourning there; thus spoke the poet: 'A cruel deed is this which I have heard concerning the loss of the king and the queen upon Slíabh Fúaid,' said he, 'but it is not right for me to speak of it, for I was not present at that time, though I have heard it from others;” thus spoke the poet","It was a great sorrow to him that he had not been able to obtain the head of the king and the head of the son, although he had often sought it in the time of his life, but never did he find it; for the head of the king and the head of the son were not found by any man until the night when they were taken from the hill of Eneach, Aineach; for it was very dark on that night when the heads were taken from the hill to the morning. He made a great lament there; thus he spoke: 'A terrible wrong has befallen me in the loss of the king and the head upon Slíabh Fúaid,' said he, 'but this is not right according to my own judgment, for it was not fitting that such a thing should happen to me","There was a great stir there; a man cried out: 'A wicked deed has been done to-night by the heathen and the men of Slieve Foy,' said he, 'but from my own right it is just; for though I have suffered wrong myself, yet I forgive it willingly.' Then there was an outcry there"
"There was a time for Suibhne in Luachair Dheadhadh for the battle-creatures of the hosts; he went forth into the region of the bright-hued Fiodh, shining with splendour, to Géagáil Gaible. The year of that dark one and as well from it there was food for him in that year, namely, a red-crowded, speckled pig, and a black-bellied, long-eared dog, and the drink of the Gabhla, namely, the river from the named Fiodh; thus he took thick and strong beer and the bitter drink of Suibhne in the company of that people at the time of their good fortune, thus he made known the law to them","There was a time for Suibhne in Luachair Dheadhadh for the battle-creatures of the hosts; he went forth into the region of the bright-hued fire to the plain of Glansrothach, where the Gégalloinn Gaible were. He had that year and also afterwards food from that year, namely, a red-crowded sheep, roasted with its entrails and its hind-quarters of dark-hued deer, and the drink of the Gabhla, namely, the river from the named place of the fire, and he took there thick and strong beer for Suibhne in that time of his misfortune to live upon, and he gave him the portion of a small loaf","There was a time for Suibhne in Luachair Dheadhadh for the battle-kingdoms of the foreigners; he went forth into the realm of the mighty and powerful, to the plain of Fidh Glansrothach, where the Gailbhean were. He lived through that year and afterwards, having food from it, namely a year of the red deer, the spotted hind and the dark-hued stag, and the drink of the Gabhla, namely the river from the named place of the fennel, and he took from there a thick and strong drink, and the noble men of the foreigners in that time were not able to prevent him from going, for they had no power to oppose his course","There was a time for Suibhne in Luachair Dheadhadh for the people of the east; he went forth to the realm of the fair and strong Fiodh glansrothach, the Géagáloinn Gaible. He asked for that year and afterwards from the food of that same year, namely a white-horned ram with curved horns and dark red flesh, and the drink of the Gabhla, namely the river from the named place of Fiodh; thus he commanded them to bring strong and abundant rain and snow to Suibhne in the course of that year for his good fortune, thus he declared the law to them"
"Then afterwards Suibhne went to Eorann where he was in the house of the king's steward, and said: 'Sadhalp, that is, Eorann,' said he, 'what will be my sadhalp?' 'It is true,' said Eorann, 'and it is within her.' 'It does not concern me,' said Suibhne, 'that you do not take from the people of the house.' 'By me,' said the woman, 'you have no right to any day that you have taken from me and from which you did not wish to be separated; let it be done and let us not delay between us, in the way that your sight was not clear on that very day when they were brought to you, the same as the sight of the blind man himself.' 'That is a sad thing,' said Suibhne, 'from the wrong that was given to women after those words. Once my manner towards women was good, in such a way that I gave one hundred cows and fifty oxen, and on the day before we went to Oilill Cédach, king of Ua Fhaoláin, it would have been good for your sight.' Then she said here below","Then afterwards Suibhne went to Eorann where he was in the house of the king's steward, and said: 'Sadhalp. that, Eorann,' he said, 'what is your sadhalp?' 'It is true,' said Eorann, 'and it is inside,' she said. 'It will not be given,' said Suibhne, 'to one who does not take from the people of the house.' 'By me,' said the woman, 'you have no right to any day that you have taken from me & from what you do not wish to give me,' she said, 'do it and do not delay us between, in a way which is not our own sight of that form of the deeds of those who have been appointed to you by the form of the deed itself.' 'That is sorrowful,' said Suibhne, 'from the wrong given to women after those words. Once was good my custom with the woman, in a way I gave her one hundred cows & fifty oxen, and on that day before we went to Oilill Cédach, king of Ua Fhaoláin, would have been good your sight of it'; then she said here below","Then afterwards Suibhne went to the place where Eorann was, and there he found Eorann in the house, with a sword drawn against her by the king's men. 'Slaughter,' said he, 'that is, Eorann; what will be your slaughter?' 'It is true,' said Eorann, 'and she is inside.' 'I do not fear it,' said Suibhne, 'for no one would take from the people in the gathering of the house.' 'That is my own view,' said the woman, 'that you have no right to any day that you have taken from me and from what you did not wish to be given to you. Do this journey and do not delay us between, for the way which was not our own, your sight has seen a beautiful face of the people who were with you in the gathering.' 'That is indeed,' said Suibhne, 'from the wrong that was done by the side of women after those words. Once my behavior towards the woman was good, so that I gave her one hundred cows and fifty horses, and it was on the day before we went to Oilill Cédach, king of Ua Fhaoláin, that would have been good for your sight'; then she said there:","Then afterwards Suibhne went to Eorann where he was in the house of a man of the royal race, and he said to him: 'Sadhalp. that is, Eorann,' said he, 'what is your sadness?' 'It is true,' said Eorann, 'and it is within me.' 'It is not fitting,' said Suibhne, 'that you do not take the people in the company of the man of the house.' 'By myself,' said the woman, 'you have no right to mean anything to each day that passes from you & as from which you do not desire to be with him,' said she, 'do it, and do not delay us between, according to the way which is not fitting your sight of that form for those people who were brought before you by the form itself.' 'That is sad,' said Suibhne, 'from the wrong given to the side of women after those words. Once was good my conduct towards the woman in the house of the poet, according to the way which I gave a hundred cows & fifty horses, and for each day before we went to Oilill Cédach, king of Ua Fhaoláin, would be good your sight of her'; then she said there:"

The woman of the harp-playing, with her companions, was in the company of the warriors. A woman of the sons of the kings was in Dun Forgaill. She brought with her a number of druids and declaimers to Emir. It is she who is the woman of the most beautiful of women of Erin for her beauty and grace. And it is she who is the woman of the six kinds of beauty, namely: the beauty of form, the beauty of voice, the beauty of manner, the beauty of dress, the beauty of bearing, and the beauty of speech. But Cú Chulaind was not a woman of comely appearance in age, form, lineage, beauty, or grace; rather, he was a man who had learned from the women of Erin neither song nor the things which are not fitting for the people of Erin to speak of. And indeed, it is she who is the woman of the noble birth and the customs of old. It is the most beautiful form of beauty that is in Cu Chulaind","Forranic Cu Chulaind in ingen ina cluichemag cona comoltaib impe. The woman of the harp-player was a companion to him in his battles. A woman was chosen for the sons of the warriors in Dun Forgaill. She was brought by the druids and the poets to h-Emir. It is she who is the most beautiful of women of Erinn, to whom I give praise and love. And it is she who has the six kinds of beauty, namely: beauty of face and beauty of form, beauty of voice, beauty of skin, beauty of manner, beauty of grace. Cú Chulaind was not a woman of such comeliness in age and form and lineage and fairness and grace as those women of Erin who were not given to love and who did not give their hearts to the men of Erin unless it was for some reason. And indeed, she is the most beautiful among the women of the old customs. It is the true love that is the greatest treasure of Cu Chulaind","Forranic Cu Chulaind in ingen ina cluichemag cona comoltaib impe. The daughter of the woman who was in the playing-place with him was beautiful. The woman was the wife of the king of Dun Forgaill. She was carried to the assembly of druids and declaimers at Emir. This is the daughter who was a fair one among the daughters of Erin, whom I have praised and whose beauty is known. And it is this daughter who had the six kinds of beauty, namely: the beauty of form, the beauty of voice, the beauty of grace, the beauty of countenance, the beauty of manner, the beauty of bearing. But Cú Chulaind was not like that daughter in age and form and lineage and clearness and sweetness, for he was not as beautiful as any of the daughters of Erin who were fair and those who did not surpass the daughters of Erin in beauty. And indeed it is the beginning of the composition of the modes of old. It is the first part of the praise of Cu Chulaind"

'Three spear-thrusts for thee,' said she, 'the thrust of the red-shouldered bird.' 'Strike!' said Cú Chulaind. Under the blows came the warriors after him. It is the (well-known) story here, that Cú Chulaind Scáthach took from them the track & the road, and with him was the battle, and he cast them into the crowd, so that every one of them was beaten, and none escaped, and they cried out: 'Focen, O scithbuidne!' &c.

"Foidis Uathach was slain by Cú Chulainn, and now Scáthach is in mourning for him, her sorrow being great. It was then that she went to Scáthach and the people of Uathchú's daughter, and there she gave birth to a son who was destined to be in Mumain, namely Lugaid mac Nois mac Alamaic, the king of sovereignty, coicceli (that is, comalta) Cú Chulainn. She bore two sons and two daughters, who were given as a gift to the men of Munster for the marriage of the two daughters of Níadhfér, son of Rusa. This was accepted by the warriors of the world. When afterwards Forcall Monuch came to her, he gave her to Teumraig, and she was betrothed to Lugaid, who was then in the company of the daughter of Eriu, between whom there was a difference in form, race, and lineage. The betrothal of Lugaid was good for him. Afterwards Forculd's daughter was given as wife to the king and to the two daughters of the men of Breghu who had not been married before, but were given to Lugaid","Foidis Uathach was slain by Cú Chulainn, and Scáthach afterwards forced him to be her pupil. It is said that at that time he went to Scáthach and her people, the daughter of Uathach, and there he learned the art of war from a man who was in Mumu, namely Lugaid mac Nois mac Alamaic, the king of the plain, the coicceli (that is, the champion) of Cú Chulainn. He taught them the science and the two arts of the men of Munster for the purpose of making a war on the two daughters of Níadhfér, son of Rusa. This was done by the warriors who were in the rear. When afterwards Forcall Monuch came to him, he gave him to Teumraig, and he made a promise to Lugaid that he would be his pupil until the time when the daughter of Eriu would come between the forms and generations and the lamdæ. The promise which Lugaid made was good. Afterwards Forculd's daughter was given to the king and to the two daughters of the men who had not been wronged by Breghu, from the men of the arts, for they were not able to do anything against Lugaid","Foidis Uathach was slain by Cú Chulainn, and now Scáthach was forced to take him as her pupil. It is said that she took him from the territory of Scáith, and his mother was the daughter of Uathqu, and she gave him to a warrior who was in Mumu; namely, Lugaid mac Nois mac Alamaic, the king of sovereignty, coicceli (that is, comalta) Cú Chulainn. The men of the territory of Munster, both the nobles and the commoners, were divided into two groups to go to war against the two daughters of Níaidhfér mac Rusa. This was a great battle in which many warriors fell on either side. When Forcall Monuch afterwards came to the place, he went to Teumraig and fought against Lugaid, who was then in the company of his wife and her people from Eriu, concerning form, kindred, and lineage. The fight between Lugaid was good for him. Afterwards, Forculd's daughter was given to the king and to the daughter of the woman who had not been wronged by Breghu, concerning the group that had not been defeated by Lugaid","Foidis Uathach was the son of Coin Culaind, and thus Scáthach trained him in the art of milting. It was at that time that he went to Scáthach and her people, the daughter of Uathqu, and they gave him a warrior who had been raised in Mumain, namely Lugaid mac Nois mac Alamaic, the king of the sovereignty, the coicceli (that is, the comalta) of Con Cúlaid. The men of the Muman brought two young warriors to Scáthach for training, the sons of Níaidhfér, son of Rusa. He trained them in all the arts and skills of war. When Forcall Monuch came to him later, he taught him the art of Teumraig and was skilled in the skill of Lugaid, so that he could teach young girls in Eriu to make things and to produce offspring. Lugaid was good at teaching his students. After that, Forculd's daughter was given to a king and to two women who would not have bad children from Breghu, but rather from the noble line of the Muman"
"The king gave the fair woman a single portion of Forgauld's food, which was prepared. When afterwards Emir of Lucctith came to the place where she was sitting, he took her two arms. 'For true is your word and your promise!' said she, and Adamair was wounded and for his grievance was black and collared with a single ox hide for the bearing thereof. Not afterwards did Lugaid make a feast for Emir in company with Con Culaind, and they went to the house","The king gave the fair woman a single portion of Forgauld's food, which she had prepared. When afterwards Emiur of Lucctith came to the place where she was sitting, he took her two arms. 'For true is your word and your promise!' said she, and Adamair was wounded and for his grievous wound, and a collar of gold was given to him as a gift. Not afterwards did Lugaid make a feast for Emir in company with Con Culaind, and the house was filled with guests","The king gave the ban-feis to one Lia Forgauld, who was able to do it. When afterwards Emir of Lucctith came into the house where she was sitting before him, she gave her two sons. 'For true is your word and your promise!' said she, and Adamair was the most beloved and for his grace was he, and Coll Oinigh was the one who brought the food to them. Not afterwards did Lugaid take the feis from Emir in the presence of Con Culaind, and the woman went out from the house","The king gave the maiden a golden ring, which was worth a cow of Forgall. The time after that, when Emir of Luchtath was in the house where she would be sitting before him, they took her two brothers. 'For the true son and heir of my father!' said she, and Adamair was the one who was beloved by Cu Culaind and for his strength and was a good man to be trusted with treasure. Not afterwards did Lugaid make a feast for Emir in company with Con Culaind, and he sent gifts to her house"
"There was a battle for Scáthach against Issan, the old man of the age of the people, and it was for her that the beautiful Aife was taken. They afterwards gave a reward (i.e., a pledge) of a line to Scáthach Cú Chulaind, and they made a truce and peace between them, regarding the battle on the side of the people who were in the battle, and on the side which was not. On account of that, he gave her a gift; it was said that this day was a great sorrow for Cú Chulainn after the death of his foster-father; for he had been a good companion to him before the death of his foster-father, and it was very sad for them in that place","There was a battle for Scáthach against Issan, the old man of the age, and for the people of Alba; and it was not far from the side that Bánflaith Aífe was. They were wounded afterwards by the weapons which were given in the battle, according to law (i.e., the decision) of Scáthach Cú Chulaind, and they were dispersed in flight and defeat, two swains who did not remain on the side of the people in the battle, on the side that was not theirs. On account of this, he gave them a gift; they were brought to him by the men of the household. They were carried out today from Cú Chulaind's house after the battle, when the victor had been determined; for it was a great honor which was given to them in that place, because they were not defeated by any man of the host in the battle, and it was very honorable which was done there","There was a battle for Scáthach against Issan, the son of Ailill, and for the time of the old age of her people; and it was a great victory for Aife. They afterwards gave a reward to each warrior who had fought in the battle, according to law (i.e., a hundred cows) to Scáthach Cú Chulaind, and they made a peace between them and the plundering and the wounds of the two sides which were done in the battle, on the sides that were not. On account of this deed he did, there was a great praise for him in the company of Cú Chulaind after the battle; for it was a great honor that he had given to the men who had fought with him in the battle, and it was a great glory which they received therein","There was a battle for Scathach against the sons of Issand, and the time of old age was upon her people, and it was not for her to be a wife to Aife. Then they made an agreement afterwards that the line of the gift should be given in the battle, according to right (i.e., the law of the docenglad), to Scathach Cú Chulaind, and she should be separated from her husband, and deliver up the two sons of Suain who had been taken against their will from the people in that battle, from those who were not willing. For the purpose of this, they made a covenant with him. They gave this to him: 'Today let it be known in Cú Chulaind's presence, after the promise was given; for he was the best of warriors, and none else had ever been found among them as good as he in battle, so great was his valor there"
"There were two sons of Scathqu who fought at the head, three sons of Ilsvanaigh, namely Cuar and Cet and Cruifne; they stood three miles from Aifi. I crossed over to their three in one and divided them. There was a battle between them and they were defeated by the men of Sléibhe, each man killing his fellow until the two sons of Idhnæ fought against each other. They divided the three sons of Esse: Enchinne and Cirí and Birí and Bailcne, three miles from Aiffe and they separated the company for the two sons of Scathqu. They divided them for the third time. Under the head of Scathach, they divided the portion; neither knew what was given to him. All who were in the battle, without any of the men of Scathce, were three times more than those who were with Aiffe in the battle-fight; it was not a fair division, for the portion given to them was less than that which should have been given. There were two sons of Cú Chulainn before his two sons and the woman who was not a leublaing for the third time and immacomarnic, they did not give him anything in three times and they gave him a portion","There was a battle between the two sons of Scathqu and three sons of Ilsvanaigh, namely Cuar and Cet and Cruifne; they were three thousand of Aifi. I crossed over to their third part, and I went with them. There was a division in the battle, and they fought against each other until the two hosts met in the plain. They divided the three sons of Esse: Enchinne and Cirí and Birí and Bailcne, three thousand others of Aiffe, and they separated from the two sons of Scathqu. They went forth for the third part. Under the head of Scathach, they divided them, and no one knew what was done or what was not done. All who were there had no knowledge of the matter concerning the two sons of Scathce; they were three in number, and they gave a gift to Aiffe in the battle, and it was a great gift that they gave. There was a battle between Cú Chulaind and his two sons, and the other side, for the fourth part, and they did not give him anything in three parts, and they laid down their weapons","There were two sons of Scathqu, who fought at the head of three sons of Ilsvanaigh, namely Cuar and Cet and Cruifne; they were three miles from Aifi. I crossed over to their three in one and divided them. There was a battle upon them, and they took her into the Slvaig, each one according to his own strength. They were three sons of Esse: Enchinne and Cirí and Birí and Bailcne; three miles from Aiffe, and they went forth against the two sons of Scatqui. They went forth for the third time. Under the head of Scathach, they divided the spoil, not knowing what or who was to be taken. All that was there was without in the forest of the two sons of Scathce; Frisan took three times and gave it to Aiffe in the bainfendig, and it was a great gift which they gave to him. There were two sons of Cú Chulaind upon his two sons and the other side for the fourth time, and they did not give them a third part among them, but they divided the spoil","There was a war between the two sons of Scathqu, in which three sons of Ilsvanaigh, namely Cuar and Cet and Cruifne, were on the side of three thousand of Aifi. I crossed over to their third part, and they defeated us. There was a battle at Arnauharuch, and they took the woman from the Slvaig in every direction until the two sons of Idhnæ were wounded by the right hand. They made war against the three sons of Esse: Enchinne and Cirí and Birí and Bailcne, three thousand others of Aiffe, and they fought with them for the two sons of Scatqui. They made war against them in every place. Under the protection of Scathach, they divided the spoils; nothing was given to any one. All who had not been wounded were without any of the three sons of Scathce, and it was not known what was theirs or what was their own. The other side was without a man from the three sons of Scathce, and the right hand of Aiffe was in the battle-fight, and they were not kind to them; they gave no share to any one. There was a war between Cú Chulaind and his two sons and the women who were with him for the fourth part and he had not made peace with them in three parts, and he fought with them in a single place"
"Aiffi's spear was aimed at Scathach. Cv of Cú Chulaind struck Aiffi on the head and pierced her with a sharp point, which was afterwards bound around her. Scathach said: 'This is what I feared for you,' she said, 'from both your parents and from your kin.' They fought together before the company of Cú Chulaind and Aiffi and the warriors of the host. Then Cú Chulaind broke (i.e., severed) Aiffi's arm in front of Cu Chulaind, so that her hand was not able to wield her sword. Said Cú Chulaind: 'Alas!' he said, 'you have wounded Aiffi and her two parents with the sharp point from the head of a hound.' Aiffi fell down. Cú Chulaind struck her on the shoulder and took from her both hands and arms and cast them behind him as he went forward, and the warriors of the host followed after him, and they fought together with wild dogs of Cú Chulaind with him, and they were victorious over the people of the land and over the weapons of the enemy. Aiffi said: 'I am not in my right mind, O Cú Chulaind!' she said. 'My three druids are with me!' he said. 'It is not a test or trial that I have given you,' she said. 'It is three druids,' he said, 'who will go to Scathach without any reward from her afterwards, and who will be my reward for the gifts which were given to me by the people of the land and by the sons of Dam.' 'I am not in my right mind,' she said. 'They will be given to you as a gift.' Then Cú Chulaind went to Aiffi and struck her with this very blow. Said afterwards to Aiffi that she was a terrible woman and a daughter of a noble man. 'She will live for seven years in Ireland,' she said, 'and she will give you a name.' Cú Chulaind gave the spear of the king's son and went forth, and he proclaimed over it that it would be given to the people of Ireland when the spear was full of blood and the proclamation was made so that her name would be known in the land of Conlui and proclaimed that no one would know the enemy or not know the enemy from the enemy, nor would they fight with the enemy or not fight with the enemy","Aiffe's focus was on the company of Scathaig. The lot of Cú Chulaind was at the head of Aiffe and her two sons, and it was said that they were not in the service of the king. Said Scathach: 'It is indeed that they are not in the service of the king,' she said, 'the two sons and their carvings.' They fought together for the company of Cú Chulaind and Aiffe and the fair-haired ones. Then Cú Chulaind broke (i.e., cut) after Aiffe's arm for the head of Cú Chulaind, so that six wounds were made on her sword. Said Cú Chulaind: 'Alas!' he said, 'you have wounded Aiffe and her two sons with their carvings from the gleam of the battle.' Aiffe fell down. Cú Chulaind struck at her fall and took from her both hands and the shield, and then he threw it behind him as a sign of victory, and the wild boar of Cú Chulaind was with him, and they fought together for the land of the two and for the sword of the warriors. Said Aiffe: 'I am not in your power, O Cú Chulaind!' she said. 'My three druids are with me!' he said. 'It is not a battle or a trial that I have come to,' she said. 'It is three druids,' he said, 'who will fight for Scathaig who has not given her service after this, and I will be in your place of the gift from the people of the land and the son of the king.' 'I am not in your power,' she said. 'They will give you a reward for that deed.' Then Cú Chulaind went to Aiffe and gave her the aid of that thing. Said afterwards into Aiffe: 'You are a woman and a daughter of a man.' 'It is seven years since I came to Ériu,' she said, 'and I will give you a name.' Cú Chulaind gave the sword of the gold and silver and the sign of victory for the company of the people of Ériu in the time when the sword was full of gold and silver and the sign of victory, so that it would be your name to the battle of Conlui and the sign of victory not to the people of the land nor to the people who are not of the land, nor to those who do not fight with the company of the people","Focraiss Aiffe comlonn for Scathaig.

The girl Cu and Cú Chulaind went together at the head of Aiffi, and they gave her a great wound before her face. Said Scathach: 'It is this that is the greatest wound for her,' said she, 'to these two eyes and in the carotid artery.' They were both wounded by the blow from Cú Chulaind and Aiffi and were struck with heavy blows. Then Cú Chulaind broke (i.e., severed) afterwards Aiffi's arm at the wrist before Coin of Cú Chulaind, so that it was not able to wield its sword. Said Cú Chulaind: 'Ail amai!' said he, 'bring aid to Aiffi and her two eyes which were cut from the white of the eye.' Aiffi fell down. Cú Chulaind struck her in the fall and took both her arms and her feet and carried them after him while walking, and caused a great crowd of savage men to follow Cú Chulaind with him, gathering together the people of the land and taking the swords of those who were present. Said Aiffi: 'You are not right in your mind, O Cú Chulaind!' said she. 'My three rings are here for me!' said he. 'A great wound has been made to me or a test of my strength,' said she. 'It is three rings,' said he, 'which I gave to Scathach who did not return them afterwards, and which I had given her on the plain of Dúnchairn and in the house of Mac Dám.' 'I am sorry for that,' said she. 'It was decreed upon you by that knowledge.' Then Cú Chulaind went towards Aiffi and gave her this aid. Said afterwards to her Aiffi, that she was a great woman and the daughter of the king. 'Cvirfed-sa 'div dia secht m-bliadan co h-Érin h-e,' said she, 'and I will give you a name.' Cú Chulaind gave her a sword of gold and a shield with the image of her emblem on it in the land of Ériu when the sword was fully made and the shield was completed, and that was her name given to her by Conlui and that she did not bear the name of any other or take the name of another before that"

"The girl went into the fortress and gave her father's sword to her brother. Cú Chulainn went into the fortress, and every man of them was afraid. The men of the Fomorians came back against Connell and Lægairi. They made a great slaughter in the fortress of the Fomorians, but they did not believe the girl among them. A great cry was raised for the king and for each man on every side. Cú Chulainn went to the two champions and spoke to the girl kindly. 'I will protect the girl,' said Ruad, 'and I myself will fight her.' 'No,' said Cú Chulainn. 'The girl shall go from here with twelve men to Ériu, and she shall bring them all safely","The girl went to the fortress and gave her father's sword to her uncle. Cú Chulainn went to the fortress also, and he took all the weapons. The men of the Fomorians came back against Connell and Lægairi. They made a great slaughter in the fortress of the Fomorians, but they did not believe that the girl was among them. The king and every man who was present there were wounded with wounds. Cú Chulainn went to the two champions and spoke to the girl about her recognition. 'I will give you the girl,' said Ruad, 'and I myself will be your servant.' 'No,' said Cú Chulainn. 'The girl shall go from this land to the land of Ériu with me, and I will bring her safely","The girl went into the fortress, and her father gave her his sword of Ulster. Cu Chulaind went into the fortress also, as did every man of the company. The men of the host returned to Conall and Lægairi. They made a great feast in the fortress, as was the custom of the Fomóre upon them, but they did not believe the girl among them. A great slaughter was made for the king and for each man on every occasion. Cu Chulaind went into the company of the men and spoke to the girl, saying: 'I will be your husband,' said Ruad, 'and I myself will protect you.' 'No,' said Cu Chulaind. 'The girl shall go with me from this place to Erin, and she shall have a good welcome there","The girl came to the fortress and showed her father's face to him. Cú Chulainn came from the fortress in the same way as all others. The noble men returned together to Conall and Léagairi. This sorrow is for them, as it was for the Danes of the Fomorians, but they did not believe their girl. A great cry of lamentation was raised for the king and for every one who had ever been slain. Cú Chulainn went to the woman's chamber and spoke to her kindly. 'I will protect this girl,' said Ruad, 'and I myself will take care of her.' 'No,' said Cú Chulainn.

"Alas, the battle was at the ford of Loch Quan, and they were cut down by two men from the sea. The woman of Cu Chulaind struck a stone, and it was not broken by the spear. The man of the Cúailnge came forth after the battle with the hound. Alas, the battle was fierce, and the two sides were equal in strength. It was there that Derbforgaill daughter of Ruaid and her companion were. 'Woe is me for your death, O Cu Chulaind!' she said. 'It is a great sorrow to see you thus wounded.' Cu Chulaind sat on the stone until his wounds were healed. 'I will not be known as one who fled,' said Cu Chulaind, 'but rather as one who died with your blood. I have given my life for the son of Lugaid Reonercc.' And so that lament was composed","Now was the battle at the ford of Loch Quan, and they were two men from the sea. The man Cu Chulaind struck a stone which was in the middle of the plain and the woman did not speak to the people. The man of the Cúailnge came forth after he had been wounded by the woman's hand. Now was the battle again, and this is what happened: that the two men were together and they would be slain by the sea. This is what happened: Derbforgaill daughter of Ruaid and her companion. 'Wicked is your deed against me, O Cu Chulaind!' she said. 'It is not a matter of which you are guilty.' Cu Chulaind sat on the stone with his hand upon his breast. 'I will not be known for this,' said Cu Chulaind, 'you have taken my life. I give to you the knowledge of the boy, namely Lugaid Reontarcc.' And thus was that speech made","Oh, indeed, they were in the ambush of Loch Quan, and they had been struck by two men from the sea. The woman of Cu Chulaind took a stone and threw it at them, and she did not spare their eyes. The man of the Cúailnge was wounded in the side after the battle with the woman of the Eógan. Oh, indeed, they were pursued, and this is how they were driven from the place where they had been assembled. This is what happened, Derbforgaill daughter of Ruaid and her companion. 'Wicked is your deed, O Cu Chulaind!' she said. 'It is a great shame that you have done this.' Then Cu Chulaind sat on the stone with his body covered in blood. 'I will not be remembered for this,' said Cu Chulaind, 'for your blood is spilled. I will make a covenant with the son of Lugaid Reonercc.' And thus was that agreement made","O, what a terrible slaughter was made in the plain of Loch Quan yesterday, and two men from the sea were slain. The woman of Cú Chulainn struck the stone, which was full of fire and not broken by the hand of the young man. The warrior came to her in the morning after the battle had been fought. O, what a great lamentation was made, for the daughter of the king was wounded and her beauty was lost. It is said that Derbforgaill, daughter of Ruaid and her foster-mother, said: 'Wicked is your deed, O Cú Chulainn!' she said. 'This is not a noble action which you have done.' Cú Chulainn sat on the stone in sorrowful mood. 'I do not know what to do,' said Cú Chulainn, 'you have taken my life. Give me death, O Lugaid Reontarcc!' and that was the end of the matter"
"And behold Cu Chulainn in the year of the battle of Dún Forcaill, and it was not accepted by the daughter of Fergus that she should be his wife. Then Cu Chulainn went to Luglochtaib Logha to Dún Forgaill, and he took from them a chariot with its cover, on that day, and he broke it in pieces under him, namely, three hundred and sixty, and the number of them was not known, and as for the covering of the chariot of Cu Chulainn, it is said to be made of iron, or of his own hair, or of his own skin","And behold Cu Chulainn in the year of the battle of Dún Forcaill, and it was not the daughter of the woman who was with him at the time of his death that they sought. Then Cu Chulainn went to Luglochtaib Logha to Dún Forgaill, and he took a chariot of fire on that day, and he struck down a great host before them, namely, three hundred and non-battle, and as for the tree which was in the place where the battle was fought by Cu Chulainn, it is upon its branches that the birds of the air used to sit, or upon its branches they used to perch at the beginning","And behold Cu Chulainn in the springtime of the year, when he was in the fortress of Forcaill, and the maiden did not accept him for his appearance. Then Cu Chulainn went to Luglochtaib Logha to the fortress of Forgaill, and he took a great spear from the carbat of the warriors that day, and he broke it through the middle, namely, three hundred and non-bair, and this was the length of the spear for Cu Chulainn, and it is thus measured by his own measures in the yard, or by his serdaib which are set at the beginning","And behold Cu Chulaind in the autumn season came forth from the fortress of Forcaill and did not accept the daughter of the woman who was waiting for her company. Then Cu Chulaind went forth to Luglochtaib Logha to the fortress of Forgaill, and he took a great battle with them on that day and slew a great number, namely three hundred and ninety, and from that time forth, the hill of Cu Chulaind was called Tórannclius. And it is upon that place that the assembly of men of war who were in readiness assembled, or upon their serpents they went to battle at the beginning"

"Cu Chulainn went to Crufóid. A woman gave him her name before that. She bent down and took the great battle-shields from the warriors who were in that place, and she carried the blood-stained cloaks over every warrior. 'This is the wound of the spear today, Cu Chulainn!' said the girl. Then, because of that, the daughter of Croofoit, i.e., the daughter of the spear, went to the battle for the plain of Ath an Imfoit against Boinn. Emiur was killed by her. Cu Chulainn took the chariot towards the direction where the blood of the foal of the horse was spilled over the warriors. He brought a second foal from the foals of the horses to replace them. Then, because of that, Ath n-Imfhoid was taken by the two foals for the daughter and her sister","Cu Chulainn went to Crufóid. A woman gave him her name then. She bent down and took the great battle-shields from the warriors who were in that place, and she cast the blood of the slain over every man. 'This is the wound of the spear today, Cu Chulainn!' said the girl. Then Croofoit, that is, the spear, was brought forth. The battle was fought before Ath an Imfoit for Boinn. Emiur fell there by the sword. Cu Chulainn took the shield from the way and cast it over the heads of the horses. He gave a blow to the shield which was on the head of the horse, and he broke the horse's head. Then Ath n-Imfhoid came forth from the two shields, one on each side","Cu Chulainn went to Crufóid. A woman gave him her name then. She bound her great dogs against the spears that were in that place, and she cast the blood of the slaughtered over every warrior. 'This is the wound of the hero today, Cu Chulainn!' said the woman. From that, the daughter of Croofoit, i.e., the wound, went to the battle before Ath an Imfoit for Boinn. Emiur came upon him with a spear. Then Cu Chulainn took the shield from the direction of the spear which was in the side of the horses over the ford. He cast the shield beyond the ford to the place where the horses were bound by their sides. From that, Ath n-Imfhoid went to the aid of the two foils, and the other","Cu Chulainn went to Crufóid. Then the woman gave her name to that one. He bent his great shields before the spears which were in that place, and he cast the moats of the blood-tainted streams over every warrior. 'This is the wound of the spear today, O Cu Chulainn!' said the woman. From that wound came the daughter of Croofoit, i.e., the wound. He went to the battle before Ath an Imfoit for Boinn. Emiur was thrown from it. Then Cu Chulainn placed his shield before the direction where the spear had pierced the flesh of the horse beyond the ford. He placed another ford beyond the place where the spear had pierced the flesh of the horses for the other ford. From that came Ath n-Imfhoid of the two fords, and the other"
"What did the woman do who killed Cú Chulainn, hundred men before each ford from Ath Scénmenn to Ollbíne to Boind Breg and all the women of that company, who were in the young girl's company and went safely afterwards? Then came Eimhear, the daughter of Cráebuaidh Concopuir, to the assembly of Ulaid and was chosen by them as a champion. There was a man from Ulltai who stood up, namely Bricne Nemtenga mac Carbad. Conad said then: 'It is fitting for you,' he said, 'to go with Cú Chulainn tonight to meet the men of Ulaid and the young girl will be at the feast with Concopuir tonight, for it is less than a hundred girls from the Ulaid who are in the company.' Then Coin Chulainn was not satisfied with that meeting and then he went to the place where the men were assembled, and there he was given the choice of going with the men to fight against the Ulaid and he went out afterwards with the young girl","What did the woman do who killed Cú Chulainn, hundred men before each ford from Ath Scénmenn to Ollbíne to Boind Breg and all the women of that company, who were in the young girl's company and went safely afterwards? Then came Eimhear, the daughter of Cráebuaidh Concopuir, to the assembly of Ulaid and was chosen by them as a champion. There was a man from Ulltai who stood up, namely Bricne Nemtennach, son of Carbad. He said: 'I will take it,' he said, 'from Cú Chulainn tonight, and the young girl will be with me tonight at Concopar, for it is less to carry a hundred girls than to carry the Ulaid's daughter.' Then was Coin Culainn seized there on account of that speech, and then they brought him to the place where his men were assembled before the battle in the plain and he went out from them","What did the woman do who was killed by Cú Chulainn, one hundred men for every ford from Ath Scénmenn to Ollbíne to Boind Breg and all the hosts of Ulaid before them? The women of that kind were not known in the province and they went safely afterwards. Then came Eimhear, the daughter of Cráebuaidh Concopuir, to the assembly of the men of Ulaid, and she was praised by them. There was a man who had been wounded, from Ulltai, that is Bricne Nemtennach, son of Carbad. Conad, who was present there, said: 'It is not right for him,' he said, 'to be with Cú Chulainn tonight and the young woman to be seen by Concopuir tonight, for it would be worse than a hundred women of Ulaid being killed.' Then Coin Culaind was not satisfied with that speech and then he went forth in anger from the assembly and there was a battle between them and the men of Ulltai, and they went out to fight against them","What did the woman do who was slain by Cú Chulainn, a hundred men for every ford from Ath Scénmenn to Ollbíne to Boind of Breg and the company of those men who were in the army of the women and they went safe after that, going back to Emvin Macha, as was the custom. Then Eimhear of Cráebruaidh Concopuir came with the people of Ulaid to fight against them. There was a man who brought gifts to the Ulaid, namely Bricne Nemtenga mac Carbad. Then Cú Chulainn said: 'It is not fitting for you,' he said, 'to be here tonight and the woman small who will be with Concopar tonight, for it is less than a hundred women of the Ulaid who are given.' Then in Coin Culaind they heard this and then they went to the place where the people were assembled, and there was a man who gave them their share according to the law of the assembly, and they went out from thence"
"It is very difficult and,' said Cathbad, 'but I have not made a vow to the king concerning the deeds of Bricriu that I will do. You would be Cu Chulainn forever in the place of the woman's hand,' he said. 'Cu Chulainn is black!' said Conchobar, 'the man who has taken the blood of his brother.' Then came Cu Chulainn. 'I am a bull,' said he, 'and I cast down the light of my own people to Sliep Fuid.' Then came Cu Chulainn and was not in accord with his own form of cattle and with all the other things that were bad in Sleip Fuid and did not give his own strength to him so that he would be before the face of Emna. They went forth from there, their company going forward for Cú Chulainn","It is very difficult,' said Cathbad, 'but I will not give the geis to the king without the sons of Bricne doing it. You would have Cu Chulainn remain in the place of the woman's foster-son,' he said. 'Cu Chulainn must be killed!' said Conchobar, 'the man who has taken the cattle of the bull's brother.' Then Cu Chulainn came forward. 'I will fight you,' said he, 'and I will throw your soul into the fire of Sliep Fuid.' Then Cu Chulainn went forth and was not seen with his face towards the pigs or the hounds or the birds of prey or any evil creature in Sliep Fuid, but gave his own soul to them all together for the sake of the battle of Emhain. They came upon him from every side for the slaughter of Cú Chulainn","It is very hard indeed,' said Cathbad, 'but I have not broken the king's geis which was upon me concerning Bricriu's feast. Cu Chulainn will be here tomorrow at the appointed time,' he said. 'Cu Chulainn is dead!' said Conchobar, 'the fire of his soul has been extinguished.' Then came Cu Chulainn. 'I am wounded,' said he, '& throw the spear of my strength to Slepn Fuid.' Then came Cu Chulainn again & was not seen by anyone in his form of a boar & in his shape of a wolf & in every other shape of evil creature in Slepn Fuid & did not give his own form to any man until the time of the battle of Emhain. They went forth from there with their weapons ready for Coin Culainn","It is a great shame,' said Cathbad, 'but it is not the king's geis that I have broken concerning Bricne. It would be Cu Chulainn who would be in dire straits from the very moment he took the bull,' said he. 'Let Cu Chulainn be dragged away!' said Conchobar, 'and let the head of the red-haired bull be brought to him.' Then came Cu Chulainn. 'I will fight you,' said he, 'and I will cast your lifeless body upon the grave of Sleáin Fáid.' Then came Cu Chulainn and was not afraid of them at all, but struck with his spear every single bad man in Sleáin Fáid, and gave them their due punishment, and made them leave the place. Then they came to him from every side, to fight against Cu Chulainn"
"Of the warriors who were in Ulster, I have heard of a certain woman, whose name is Comarli, who was right to be angry with them: Emer was married to Conchobar the old and Fercus and Cathbad her kinsmen. They gave her in marriage to Cú Chulainn and she bore him a son, Vlad, who was born of her womb. After that they made her suffer and the warriors of Ulster took her by force. Conchobar caused the writing of Emirie's lamentation. He gave judgment against the men of Cú Chulainn and he ordered them to be put to death without any delay","Of the warriors who were in Ulster, I have heard that they made a covenant of old. It is said that Emer was betrothed to Conchobar of the ancient time, and Fergus and Cathbad their foster-fathers, and she gave her hand in marriage to Conchobar and bore him a son, Cú Chulainn, and the woman of the household, Vlada, for his upbringing. Then they made this covenant and the warriors assembled. Conchobar was wounded in the battle of Emir, the spear-piercer. The people of the land were divided against Cú Chulainn and the king's men, and no one would stand up to fight until the death of the two champions","Of the warriors who fought in Ulster, there is no one more renowned than Cú Chulainn. It was thus that Emer came to the knowledge of Conchobar through the advice of Fergus and Cathbad, her father's kin, and she gave her hand in marriage to Conchobar, and they had a son called Connla. Then, after this, she bore him a daughter, and Conchubar made a great lament for Emer, the woman of the noble lineage. He gave judgment upon the men of Ulster, and he ordered them to be slain, and none escaped from their death by any means","May the poet sing of Ulltai, my kindred, and the old song of the caingin. It is indeed a fair comparison to make: Emer was seen by Conchobar at the festival of the old time with Fercus and Cathbad, her attendants, and she took pleasure in the company of Cú Chulainn, and was loved by Влад for his beauty. Then afterwards, he made her a gift and gave her the poet's staff. Conchobar caused to be written the tale of Emirie the fair-haired. He judged the company of Cú Chulainn, and showed favor towards her kinship, and no one will ever bring shame upon her until her death"
