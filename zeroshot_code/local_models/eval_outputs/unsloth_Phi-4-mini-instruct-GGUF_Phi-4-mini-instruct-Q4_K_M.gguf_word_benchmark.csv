If ""me"" is meant as an example similar to your provided format and assuming it's intended for translation into something contextual within a sentence or phrase from medieval Irish literature (which could mean different things depending on context like 'I', the pronoun, but without more specific text that needs translating), I'm still unable to provide direct translations since ""me"" is not enough information.

For instance:
- If you meant ""Mi"", in Middle Irish it can be a possessive or nominative form which would translate differently based upon its use.
- Or if you're asking about the word as seen at the beginning of sentences, it's usually an imperative command like 'Go!' (modern English) but context matters.
