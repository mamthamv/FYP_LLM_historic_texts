"Many battles were fought by Ultonian forces on the slopes of Slieve Faughnan, and great deeds are remembered for Conall son of Colm Chonell, Coinculaind, Lóegaire, 'Tucaid dam-sa' said to Conall: 'I sent a message from here with my comrades.' Many battles were fought by Ultonian forces on the slopes without any mercy or compassion. And many men died in battle and others fell ill","Many battles were fought by Ultonians and the people of Sliab Fuaith, including Conall Cernach, Connlaind, Lóegaire, 'Tucaid dam-sa' said to Conall: “I send this message with my hand in a ring.” They went on many campaigns against their enemies without any mercy or compassion. And they were often killed by the enemy's arrows","Many battles were fought by Ultonians and I on the slopes of Slieve Faugha, as well as Conall Ghaill, Connlaind, Lóegaire, who said 'Tucaid dam-sa' to Conall: 'I cannot send this message until my comrades are in safety.' So many battles were fought by Ultonians and me on the slopes of Slieve Faugha against Comhaltach Óenfhir Nogatta's army. And they had a great number of victories without their leaders, as well as Connlaind and Conchobar","Benevolent rulers of Ulster were great and mighty, as the sons of Sliab Fuaith [Foe]. They did not seek peace or truce with enemies unless they wished to devastate their lands alongside Christendom's army without causing harm from battle. And so noble lords desired neither war nor discord"
May God be with you and your family truly in peace,May God be with you and your family truly in peace,May you be blessed by God for the sake of your mother truly and not just in appearance,"My lord Conan said to me, 'You are not worthy of the queen truly son-in-law whom I have chosen for myself,' and Conrad replied"
"He gave the poor forsworn a foretoken before his death, saying that he would be found by an Arab slave; and when Cét mac Matach died in Hibernia, it was said of him: 'The son of Dallid is dead with Fúait's aid or three days' sickness.'","Many people have come before me from far lands, but none as great or wise has ever been heard of like you. I will tell the story to my children in Cet about how he came here with his army and conquered Fúait along with Tri Leacht","For the sake of peace, they sent a message to Aranbarrach seeking his help against Ulaith. They also sought aid from Fíatachas and Triathair for their armies in Ulster","He was found before dawn after his dogs had wandered around, unable to find a path but easily recognized by Arnabarch's seal; Dolluid of Cét mac Mátach is the first person in Ireland who swore allegiance with Ulaid and thereafter there are two paths: one going west towards Fóite and east into Leitrim"
"Fight and did Ulysses' men together at the battle of Feraig Ross, where they were defeated by Ulster's warriors; Conor gave his daughter to Connacht in marriage after he had slain her father with one blow from a spear or sword: she bore him nine sons - Niall Loech was born there. He married Cormac's wife and became king of Ireland for seven years, during which time the women were not allowed out; they could only go outside to gather herbs such as yarrow, heather, rushes, brambles, nettles: Conchobar had a son named Niall Loech who was born there. He married Cormac's wife and became king of Ireland for seven years","Fecht and didiu dolluid-seom intí Cet sair co tuc tánai mbó a Feraib Ross, Donarraid i n-íarmóracht Ulaid ina diaid; Doriachtatar dano Connachtai dond leith aile dia thessarcain-seom.

He struck down many foes from the front lines of battle for himself alone","Fecht and didiu dolluid-seom into Cet's outside, the fair one of Feraib Ross; they made Ulaid unable to move without assistance from Connacht; Conor went with great men at their backs against them all in battle; Conan attacked him fiercely while he was riding on a beautiful horse that belonged to his mother. A hundred spears were loosed and pierced through the bodies, by God's command: for every spear thrown struck flesh or bone but not wood nor any other thing except living creatures"
"Gods will be done, Cet the mighty shall not escape from Mesgegra's stronghold with his men; they are to fight in front of it as well as on its wings, for Ulaid have captured Chet and Áth Daire Dá Báeth is also a brave man","Ceithern Cet inched Mesgegra isin tábaill ocus nosteilc conidtarla immullach Conall co mbátar a dá trían inna chind ocus co torchairseom isa cend, co tarla fri lár.

"Many people gathered at Crích Ross with Sciaig Aird near Connacht, and Ulaid left their dwellings to join Áth Daire Dá Báeth's army. 'My brother is here!' Conall said of Cend Berraide who was leading the warriors by force. Dobair-side went forth without number or name except for Arddachad Emain Macha; many people gathered there, and they were all in one place together as a single unit under Cend Berraide's leadership – that is to say he ruled over Ultaib like a king throughout his life","Many people gathered at Crích Ross with Sciaig Aird near Connacht, and Ulaid left their homes to join Áth Daire Dá Báeth's army. 'My brother is here!' Conall said of Cend Berraide who was leading the forces; they went together as one man towards Arddachad Emain Macha where many people were gathered in a single place for an entire day and night, which means that he ruled Ultaib like this: his rule lasted throughout their lives","He was granted the kingship of Ulaid over Nombhairn, but he could not keep it long enough to count his years as king","But it is not well with Ross Crích and Sciaig Aird at Connacht, as the Ulaid are leaving their territory together with Ath Daire Dá Báeth; Conall said 'My brother's lost,' saying that Béror Ríg of Ulster has gone into exile for a lifetime. But Cend Berraide retorted 'Not my fault,' adding: He also left me alone, as he had done before to Ardagh Emhain Macha with the Ulaid; but I am not his brother because this title means only that one lives here on one's own estate"
"The king's daughter was married to a foreigner after the death of her father, and we mourned greatly",The king gave a gift to his people after he had conquered the enemy,The man was not ashamed of his poverty despite having a rich wife after the king,The one who knows well will hear from him after the king; we waited until Ulfart's year
"May God bless you and Conall Fingen with his friendship today; may He grant us peace in this world. 'Be well,' or Fingen, said the Ulstermen to me: 'I will not forget what I have done for your sake.'","Good morning to you with Conall and Fingen by my side today; it is the first time in many years that I have seen such beauty. May God bless us, may He not forsake me or take away this gift from You.' 'It seems as though your people are saying 'I am old'","Good day to you with Conall and Fingen there. He is here from the night before yesterday when he passed by in his boat, which was full of people; they took him away without us knowing or seeing what happened next. 'May it be well,' said Fingen, 'that this man may die for me.' Ulaid replied: 'It will not happen with you until your death comes to pass over that land","Be good with me in Connacht: 'I will be your brother on this day and forever. I am bound by an oath to you.' You can count on my support, said Finn of the Sons of Fíngen"
"Roghaid the king of Tara and Rofuaged, son of Snotheow, gave a great feast to Conchobar with red wine; also he sent messengers throughout Ireland: one after another they brought news that there was no food or drink left for men [and none remained] except women who bore children","Roderic's army was defeated and routed, with Conchobar the Black taking his place in Ireland alongside Niall of the Nine Hostages; he also took over from Fergus son of Toirdelbach as High King [and succeeded to the kingship] along with many women and children","The king gave the silver and gold to his wife, Conchobuir's daughter of the fair complexion; also he appointed a hundred chariots at her side from which she could see everything that happened on either hand [also those who were sent with them] as well as all women except for those in childbirth","From the dawn, I saw fire and smoke above iron; their colours red as Conchobair's coat of mail with that golden one which was set over them too: thus they carried weapons in order against every kind except those who could run away or retreat [except by flight]."
"Robói (Robert) is a man of great wisdom, and he was born from the loins of David; his mother bore him in Bethlehem when she had been barren for many years: 'Is this not so?' asked Conall son of Eogan. 'This mighty king has come to us,' said the druid. 'He will bring peace with justice.' 'I know that he is coming from Dan, and I have seen his army marching by in a single file","Many years ago, there was a great battle between the Romans and Britons; eight thousand of them were killed in Britain along with their leaders, including King Christ who fought against Judea's people. Then came Jesus Mac Dé from China to fight for Ireland: 'Who are you?' asked Conall the druid. 'What is your name among those many,' he replied? 'I am one of his own men.' 'You belong here in Erin with eight thousand killed and nine hundred drowned by sea, including all their ships","God bless you and your servant, who is the seventh of our race: seven generations from Adam to Christ; I will praise God for His great mercy towards us all in this world as well through Jesus Christ Our Lord's Son. 'Blessed be,' said Conall Friaid (the Irishman). 'What a greater blessing than that which you have given me?' asked the druid, and he answered: 'The greatest of blessings is God Himself.' 'It was He who gave us this land as well through Jesus Christ Our Lord's Son. Seven generations from Adam to Noah; sevenfold again in Ireland thanks be","Many years ago, there were seven kinds of beings: the giants (referred to as Columba), demons with terrible power who caused much suffering; Jesus Christ had already conquered them in Judea when he returned from Galilee and preached to Ireland. “Ask Conall Friande,” replied his druid friend. 'Do you have such a great many stories that are still unknown?' Answered the druid, 'Yes,' saying there were seven kinds of giants before Columba's time who caused destruction: one called Eniair was extremely dangerous and destroyed by fire"
"The son of Connla has not yet been killed by the day, nor will he be until after Hibernia's fall","And Sinann could not resist the temptation of Connell's beauty, for he was a man who would never be tempted by any woman except one","The son of Connail was not able to overcome the enemy on that day at Hibernia, for there were many strong men with him",The answer seems elusive
"Conan's words are attractive and pleasing to the eyes of many people in Ireland; Concubur is also known as an eloquent woman who spoke beautifully about Christ before him: 'Christ loved me,' he said, 'and I knew it.' And so did Conan know that Jesus loves his soul. Finis",Conall is the son of Abert and Concubur; he was born in Ireland with his mother as well,"Conan's sword is like the spear of Ares; it attracts and repels armies that come to meet him in battle with his brother Concobar at its head: Conan finds himself drawn towards Christ as he rides, carrying Him through all lands where He walks among them",The thief is skilled at robbing and stealing from merchants of Meath as well as Concubur in Cork; his name among the Irish men was known to be one who would steal whatever he could whenever opportunity arose
"Many people were gathered around the Messenger, and they remained silent until he spoke freely about his journey to Arable Island","Many people were afraid of the one who would take away Christ from Me, Jesus' disciples; they fled to a mountain and hid there with him for three days without food or drink except what he gave them through his spirit in His body at Easter time","The blind man who could not see the Lord's disciple, was taken up into heaven without being seen by anyone; Christ appeared to him on another occasion and told Him that He would send His disciples before them as shepherds leading their flocks in peace: but when they had all come together for worship at Jerusalem he said this about Ultaib who did not believe the true message of God. But I will tell you a parable; therefore, listen carefully","Let the blind lead the one who can see, for their way leads to ruin; they are a rock and will not move until it is too late"

This will be a great contest: Neither of them shall conquer without fighting fiercely against each other; for Óengus fought in Dinnae Chróin with his fierce spear, while they all fled from him like sheep before a wolf. Come now to battle between Huí Máil and Óengus, both brave fighters! This will be another great contest: Three times has the same number of men fallen on each side; no one shall outnumber Óengus three in four or five against them at once","Here lies Batar of Mumah, i.e., Mac Connaid and Márcan and Óengus. The body lay: Not dead from the hand or spear of these men; but by Óengus slain at Dimma-chroi because he was in a fair fight with them all around him [who were there]. A great band came to bury his bones, and another large band brought back their leader's corpse. He said that Mac Máil should be buried here as well: For three times had the boy gone over this hill; but Óengus eight times went not beyond one man's wall"
"May God protect the king of Máil tomorrow. I wish for Óengus that he may not be angry with me when we fight at dawn against those who have slain my brother and his companions yesterday; let him also spare us from death today, as well as all our weapons so they will remain in their places until morning: 'May God protect you tonight,' said the man. 'I wish for your army to not be destroyed by nightfall or any other means of destruction.'","May God protect the king of Máil. Do not fear Óengus who desires it.

He said: 'I am sorry,' he continued, 'that I was alone last night in fear of enemies coming at all hours when you were sleeping with your mother away from home.' But now his friends have come to take my possessions by force without notice; the king gave me an order that they not disturb what rightfully belongs to him. They could only do as much as their strength permitted"
"May fortune favor you, O King of the Britons! Fair is your appearance; 'Are you tall like Saint Patrick?' I replied to him: “I am not so much taller than my father.” He said that he was a little shorter and had no beard or mustache at all except for his hair. And then they both went into battle together, O King of the Britons! Aithechda also came with me in this war","May fortune favor you, O King of Munster! Fair is the day before us. 'In fair weather shall we meet,' said Owen. “I will not delay for a moment,” replied Owen again: “We must be ready to fight at once.” And so they agreed and parted that same afternoon; God knows what happened between them in those days, but Oengus was with Aithechda by the river bank","In peace, Oengus speaks with the men of Brega; he is fair and tall: 'Are you by chance from Innat-Fhail?' 'I am not,' said Oengus, 'but I have come to make war on my enemies.' The man replied, 'So be it then.' And as they sat together in peace for a time. He spoke again of his desire that all men should live peacefully without fear or harm: 'Let us fight against our foes and not ours,' he said; so with him the people gathered to listen by night after day until evening arrived when Oengus went on, followed closely behind were Aithechda's warriors","Be fair, and let your immunity grow strong; indeed it is well said: 'In what way are you tall, Oengus?' He replied to me thus: “I have nothing but this for my life in that house.” And I told him as much likewise saying he must guard the young women against ravishing them. Be vigilant lest they be defiled by any man at all and commit adultery; such sin is a heavy one indeed, with great destruction after it comes to pass: “Fight valiantly so you will not fail for anything,” said I, “for both myself as well.” And he prayed thus many times until nightfall. Then Óengus spoke again saying Aithechda must also go forth and spread his fame far henceforward"
"Colman the blind man, who was carried by his dog across a river: 'Did you see my son in Ireland? He is now twenty years old. I have not seen him since then.'

Will you give me five shillings?' He replied to him that he had no need. Colman then answered back saying something about Dana's gift for Aeneas","Why do you torment the fool in his rage, he who has not seen a single century? In your ignorance are placed seven domains of folly; such is my domain. He tempts me with words"
"May the sun shine on you, O King of Connacht Chluana! May your spear be as sharp and keen against me as it is for him who bears his own spears with pride","In truth, the son of Marb is Chluana's wife Eanacht; he gave her a necklace and she wore it with pride around his neck until they were both dead from grief over their son's death","Fearsome warriors, the sons of Marb Bachloch from Cluana's army are skilled and fierce; they will not falter or retreat until their battle-ax falls into a pit with no escape for them nor any chance to flee like Maev in her chariot","The truth of the sons is that Marbad of Chluana was captured by Eoin, and for his head he paid five hundred pounds; but when it came time to pay him again at Rath Luachra, they would not give him anything from their purses because there had been blood spilled among them. Colman gave him twenty-five in the hand-to-hand battle"
"Then the king of Bachlach, Haeena and Gabh in Rann came before her; he said to her 'My son Laigse is great among all men: He has strength for every battle.' She replied with a smile that she would not give him any more gifts except those already given. Then Colman gave his daughter Aena as wife","Then the king of Bachlach recited verses about Hela and gave him to run along the river, saying 'A great man is he who can cross this bridge; one must be strong enough for that.' Hel responded: 'I will not give my daughter in marriage unless I am asked first,' so Colman went away with her. And then Aena married Colman","Then the king and his son went down to sea with him, saying 'A great lord I am in this ship; much is my worth.' The queen said: 'I will not leave you alone until he comes back,' then she left them for a while together at Aena's side","Then I found myself swimming with Aeneas and Gabriel in the river, where Fear said to his companions that he swam as though they were two bulls: 'Is bad for you,' answered Aeneas; but Faith was not moved"
"Fight on, I will avenge you against Aithechdai and all those who wronged your side. (I shall fight with Dubchrón's son Óengus at Tan Sin.) Let me tell of the battle where we fought together; it was a great one for our people in Charr Óengus' time, when three brothers were slain by Marbad Samlaid. I will avenge you and your family from this day forward as well. Dubchrón's son is Dubglais'. 'Fight on,' said the warrior. 'I won't fight with my back to a wall.' The man replied: 'You can't win if you're not careful, even in battle; but I'll tell of it for Óengus' sake too.' And he added: 'I'll avenge you and your family from this day forward as well","Fight on! I will strike him with Aithechdai and also fight men of the same kind. (I shall not fear Dún Dubhrach, son of Oengus.) Let me go forth to battle against a great host: my spear is ready; both sword and shield are prepared for you as well.

'He lies there dead or sleeping: sit down with him; come and lie beside me too.” “I will not let my spear rest until I have slain a hundred men for you,” he replied, then added: 'The battle has begun! Now fight on against the enemy of God. May your sword strike true as it did at first!'","Fight on, I will strike him with Aithechdai and the men of his side. (I fought against Dubchrón's son Óengus at Tan Sin.) Mus learned to wield a sword without fear or anger over it; he became skilled in combat as well.

'Who is that Óengus?' asked another person standing by him with a sword drawn and ready to fight against his enemy who had come from the north; he spoke boldly saying this man has no fear of death in battle, but I will strike you down if need be","Fight now, O'Angus and I will confront them together at Aithechda's side. (I stand with all men of Dubhchoron against him.) Let me tell you this well: your name is Anghus the Red-hound who chased us to these shores; so our family fled for shelter in hiding from both the braves that came and his dogs, which were fierce as wolves on their hind legs. Behold Dobhcoron's men of Dubhchoron there with him (namely Aodh). 'I see you,' he said. 'Yes,' they replied to Angus: we will fight this way until our blood is spent like a tide in the sea.' Let me tell what happened when I saw your fierce dogs; these three were still standing on their hind legs as men, and then came out from hiding (those who fled).' Aye! O'Angus!' said Dubhchoron. 'You should know that fighting with those bloodhounds is madness,' he added.' Three of Dobhcoron's people fought Anghus at the ford; I saw them there.'"
