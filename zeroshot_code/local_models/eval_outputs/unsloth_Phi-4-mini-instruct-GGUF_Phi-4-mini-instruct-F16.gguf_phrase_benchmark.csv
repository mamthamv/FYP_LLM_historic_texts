The king's son lives happily,The king lives well and prosperously,Beneath his bed lies my son,The sun rises and sets; I am Camh
The night has come and gone; now it’s your turn to speak,The night has come and gone; now it’s your turn to speak,The night was dark and deep for you all,Nobody's clean without dirt and nobody’s dirty unless they get filthy
The air of knowledge has been lost with their departure,The air of knowledge has been lost with their departure,Air Rob Aithnídh Disi Mar Do Biadtaí A Samhla-Sumha,The sun rises over Dublin as if it sees themselves and their sisters
"A kiss of peace to Oisin, and a greeting from Cailtin's hand","The blessing of Oisin's hand and the gift from Cailleach to me, I will not forget","The blind man who saw Oisin and knew not the secret of his youth, also Cú Chulainn learned it","The word 'ocus' means 'and'. It can be translated as follows: 'And the bull of Athid Di Fossa, who never gave birth again after Oisin died; and Cailtech also came with his band to fight against him"
The sun rose over the sea of dreams and stood by Boi's side with Imraidh of Fianna and Finn Mac Cumhail,"The sun rose over the sea of green and blue hills, where the fairies danced in joy with Finn Mac Cumhaill",The sun rose over the plain of Emain Macha and stood tall in the sky above Tara's people as well as those from Fir Bolg and Connacht,The right hand may rise and the left with strength as in Ireland both England's King James II and Queen Mary I of France
"The same thing I said to you, Sir Osric and Master Oisin","The same thing to me, I will not be angry with you, Oscar and my son Ossian","The same thing I thought of for you, Osceol and Mic Oisin","The word 'táin' means something similar to treasure, and this line might be expressing a wish for peace or harmony between individuals named Oscair, Mhic Oisín (possibly two people with the same name), suggesting that their relationship is as precious ('a-tain') in importance ('sí', which could mean 'so') as it can truly 'táimrád' them to themselves. However, without more context or a clearer translation of each word and phrase within this line from medieval Irish literature (which may contain poetry), the meaning remains somewhat speculative"
A kiss for Mac Luagha and a farewell to Chath,The peace of Mac Lughach and Chath,Mighty lion of Lochlann and mighty warrior,Swords drawn by Mac Lughach and Chath or Gabriel with a rose
The wise man knows much about great sorrow,The wise man knows that death comes to all,The wise man knows that death approaches with great stealth and speed,The sun shines with great majesty and beauty
"No harm done, welcome to Ireland","No harm, welcome to Ireland","Is not welcome anymore, 'Do you still think so now?'","The welcome said, 'Do not hide now"
"The Lord God created the world and everything that lives, moves or has been made by Him alone","The Lord God created the earth and all that was on her, both great sea creatures of every kind under heaven; he also made everything to be fruitful in itself. He saw it as good","The Lord God created all the animals of every kind, both that which lives on land and that which swims in water","The goddess of victory overcomes the enemy for her people, and fights side by side with them"
"The swift-footed Oisin said to him: 'Give me your brother's hand,' and he replied, 'I will not give you my sister until I have seen her","The swift-footed Oisin said to him: 'I will give you my friendship,' and he replied, 'You shall not find a friend more loyal than I in this battle","The white raven said to him: 'I give you my friendship,' and he replied back saying that neither the sea nor any other creature in this world could surpass his friend",The raven of Ossian said to him in reply that he had granted a blessing and added 'for there are neither birds nor deer standing still for the life I gave you
The owl speaks quietly to the magpie,A good man should be calm and brave,A gentle breeze calms the restless sea,An unexpected peace for everyone involved
"The king of England, a man with great wisdom and strength","The king of England, a great and noble man","I beseech you, noble king of the world, to pardon me for my fault",The fair lady and lord of Dublin went to Morristown
The truth shall set you free and your peace will be with you,The truth shall set you free and your peace will follow,No one can predict tomorrow's troubles or your fate,Soon your enemies will vanish and peace for you
The truth shall prevail and falsehood will perish,The truth shall set you free or it will destroy you,The word or speech of man and woman are vanity,Thee have I seen you both fair and ugly alike
The king's messenger has arrived,The king's messenger has arrived,The Lord of Ireland and His People Pray for Peace,Blessed be you and all of your kin by Saint Patrick
"Aye there on the road to Erin for you, Oisin","God bless you on your journey, Oisin",Aye now we go on the road of Ossian,The sun rises on Aodh Riabhach: Oisin
The Irish are coming soon,The Irish are coming over there,A thousand years of peace,The King of Ireland and Britain was coming
A good night and sweet dreams,A good sleep and peace,A good sleep and peace,A good day and peace
A kiss from him and her mouth,A good man has his own reward,A good man knows his own place,Blessings on both of their bodies
A good place to stay,A good night's sleep,A good meeting place,Aloft from all harm
The Irish language has broken down at home,The Irish poet's broken heart will not be moved by any display of wealth or power,Satan's dance broken as it went through a town square where he thought to be found,The truth shall overcome broken pledges made by people of this country
The king's counsel and I are equal to him,A kiss on your cheek and a word of comfort to you,An evil counsel to me and a good one for you,Cock crowing a great deal and also he cries out loud to him
