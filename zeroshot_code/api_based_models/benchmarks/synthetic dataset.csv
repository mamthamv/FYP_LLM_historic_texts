Ocus intan nobítis i n-immarbáig nó chomramaib dobertis dóib co mbítis inna lámaib.,"Once upon a time the men of Ulster were greatly intoxicated in Sliab Fúait. Thence there arise great contentions and comparison of trophies between them, even between Conall and Cuchulinn and Loegaire. “Bring me,” said Conall, “the brain of Mesgegra, so that I may talk to the competing warriors.” At that time it was a custom with the men of Ulster to take the brains out of the head of every warrior whom they slew in single combat, and to mix lime with them, so that they were made into hard balls. And whenever they were in contention or at comparison of trophies, these were brought to them, so that they had them in their hands."
"“Maith, a Conall,” ar Chonchobuir, “na co ndernat óic na comram écht fón innas-[s]a ar galaib óinfhir, nídat túalngi comram frim-sa.” “Is fir ón,” ar Conall.","“Well, O Conall,” said Chonchobuir, “until the competing warriors perform a deed like this in single combat, they are not capable of comparing trophies with me.” “That is true,” said Conall."

Ised dolluid-side dar faidchi na hFúait  ocus tri láechcind leis do Ultaib.,"Then the brain was put upon the shelf upon which it was always kept. On the morrow every one went his own way to his sport. Then Cet, the son of Matu, went upon a round of adventures in Ulster. This Cet was the most troublesome pest that was in Ireland. This is the way he went, across the green of Fúait , having with him three warriors’ heads of the men of Ulster."
"Fecht and didiu dolluid-seom intí Cet sair co tuc tánai mbó a Feraib Ross. Donarraid i n-íarmóracht Ulaid ina diaid. Doriachtatar dano Connachtai dond leith aile dia thessarcain-seom.

Then the men of Connaught came up from the other side to rescue him. A battle is fought between them. Conall himself went into the battle. And it was then that the women of Connaught begged Conall to come aside so that they might see his shape. For there was not on earth the shape of a human being like the shape of Conchobar, both for beauty and figure and dress, for size and symmetry and proportion, for eye and hair and whiteness, for wisdom and manners and eloquence, for raiment and nobleness and equipment, for weapons and wealth and dignity, for bearing and valour and race. That Conall was faultless indeed. However, it was by the advice of Cet that the women importuned Conchobar. Then he went aside alone to be seen by the women."
"Dolluid Cet immorro co mbúi etir na mná immedón. Nosindlethar Cet inchind Mesgegra isin tábaill ocus nosteilc conidtarla immullach Conall co mbátar a dá trían inna chind ocus co torchairseom isa cend, co tarla fri lár. Focherddat Ulaid chuci conidrucsat ó Chet. For brú Átha Daire Dá Báeth is and dorochair Conall. Atá a lige and baile i torchair ocus corthe fria chend ocus corthe fria chossa.","Cet, however, went until he was in the midst of the women. He adjusts the brain of Mesgegra in the sling, and throws it so that it hit the crown of Conall’s head, so that two-thirds of it entered his head, so that he fell upon his head forward to the ground. The men of Ulster ran towards him, and carried him off from Cet. On the brink of the ford of Daire Dá Báeth it was that Conall fell. His grave is there where he fell, and a pillar-stone at his head, and another at his feet."
"Maidid tra for Crích Ross  co Sciaig Aird na Con. Dobertar Ulaid sair doridisi co Áth Daire Dá Báeth. “Mo brith-se ass!” ar Conall. “Dobér ríge nUlad do neoch nombéra connici mo thech.” “Notbér-sa,” ar Cend Berraide, ar a gilla fadéin.

The men of Ulster are driven eastwards again to the ford of Daire Dá Báeth. “Let me be carried out of this!” said Conall. “I shall give the kingship of Ulster to anyone who will carry me as far as my house.” “I will carry thee,” said Cenn Berraide, his own attendant. He puts a cord around him and carries him upon his back to Ardachad of the Emain Macha . The attendant’s heart broke within him. Hence is the saying over Ulster,’ ‘Cenn Berraide’s kingship over Ulster,’ to wit, the king upon his back for (only ) half the day."
Conócbad trá in debaid ón tráth co araile dar éis in ríg. Co ráimid for Ulto íarsin.,"However, the fight was kept up after the king from one hour of the day to the same hour on the next day, after which the men of Ulster were routed."
"Doberar tra a liaig co Conall .i. Fingen.

Mani tucthar ass immorro, not-ícfaind ocus bid athis duit.” “Is asso dún” ar Ulaid “ind athis oldás a éc som.”","In the meantime his physician was brought to Conall, even Fingen. ’Tis he who would know from the smoke that arose from a house how many were ill in the house, and every disease that was in it. “Well,” said Fingen, “if the stone is taken out of thy head, thou wilt be dead forthwith. If it is not taken out, however, I would heal thee, but it will be a blemish for thee.” “It is easier for us,” said the men of Ulster, “to bear the blemish than his death.”"
"Ro-íccad íarum a chend ocus rofúaged co snáth óir, ar ba cumma dath fuilt Conchobuir ocus dath inn óir.

And the physician said to Conall that he should be on his guard lest anger should come on him, and that he should not mount a horse, that he should not have connexion with a woman, that he should not eat food greedily, and that he should not run. "

At that time a great trembling came over the elements, and the heavens and the earth shook with the enormity of the deed that was then done, even Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, to be crucified without guilt. “What is this?” said Conall to his druid. “What great evil is being done on this day?” “That is true, indeed,” said the druid [who then tells the story of the Crucifixion ]. “Awful is that deed,” said Conall. “That man, now,” said the druid, “was born in the same night in which thou wast born, even on the eighth before the calends of January, though the year was not the same.”"
Is andsin rochreiti Conall. Ocus issé sin indara fer rochreti do Día i nHérinn ría tiachtain creitmi é .i. Morand in fer aile.,"It was then that Conall believed. And he was one of the two men that had believed in God in Ireland before the coming of the Faith, Morann being the other man."
"Ocus as iarsin asbert Conall: “Rofeasdais fir in beatha mo cumang ac cathugud fri hIudaidhibh tre crochad Críst dia mbeinn a comfogus dó.” Is iarsin attraacht ocus rosgobh forsin deargail cur’sceinn incinn Mesgeagra as a cinn ocus conearbailt Concubur fochétóir.

Finid.","And thereupon Conall said: “The men of the world would know what I can do in fighting against the Jews for the sake of the crucifixion of Christ, if I were near Him.” Then he rose and made the onslaught, until Mesgegra’s brains jumped out of his head, so that Conall died forthwith. Hence the Gaels say that Conall was the first pagan who went to Heaven in Ireland, for the blood that sprang out of his head was a baptism to him. And then Conall’s soul was taken to hell until Christ encountered her as He brought the captive host out of hell, so that Christ took the soul of Conall with Him to Heaven. Finit."
"Intan bátar na ónmite ’co cluchiu do inchind Me[i]sgegra, issed atbert ind ónmit fri araile. Rocluinedar Cet aní sin.

Cet hears that. He snatches the brain out of the hand of one of them, and carries it off; for he knew that it had been foretold of Mesgegra that he would avenge himself after his death. In every battle and in every combat which the men of Connaught had with those of Ulster, Cet used to carry the brain in his girdle to see whether he could compass a famous deed by slaying a man of Ulster with it."
"Loích ro bátar do Mumab .i. Mac Connaid ocus Marrcán ocus Óengus. Is de ro chét: Ní thaet didiu de in cocad fri hOssairge, cen Mac Connaid for eoch án, cen Marccán, cen Óengus.

A n-as·rubart fodessin: “Is cumma lim-sa huí Máil ocus muilenn oc blith gráin; it fáilte huí Máil fria nguin is cóir cach bró fria tuarcain.”","Mac Connaid, Marrcán and Óengus were three warriors of the men of Munster. It was sung of them: From Osraige our warband does not return without Mac Connaid on his noble horse, without Marrcán or Óengus. Óengus descendant of Dímmae Crón killed a man in the marsh: search his whole body for not one wound has struck him. Now Óengus’s neighbours were the Uí Máil and his neighbourship was bad indeed for them. Concerning this it was sung: The Uí Máil, three thousand were their number: Óengus left none but three times nine among them. Óengus himself said: “The Uí Máil and a mill grinding grain are both the same to me. the Uí Máil are welcome to the killings for every quern is proper for crushing.”"
"Athechda rí hua Máil immorro. Do·fuc Óengus a ingin. Luid-si didiu fecht do thig a [h]athar do chomfhis a mmáthar bae i ngalur. Ro aslacht a hathair fuirri-se brathtecosc a fir dó. “Maith,” ar [in] ben, “fil mo dáil-se fris i-nnocht.

Óengus married his daughter. Once she went to the house of her father to visit her mother, who was sick. Her father persuaded her that it was fitting to betray Óengus . “That is good,” said the woman, “I am meeting with him tonight. There are three huts near him and I do not know in which of them he will sleep during the night but I know the best course for you. Bring my bag full of fox-fire and I will tell him that my dress is inside it: I will follow after him, then you throw the fox-fire behind me and follow in my path.”"
"Ba fír ón. Tiagait co mbátar immun n-uarboith. Con·gairet fair. “Innat-fhail tall, a Oengus?” “Cosmail mo bith,” ar Óengus, “ocus ná marbaid for siair.

[The sons of Aithechda] went until they were near the hut and they called to him,  “Are you there, Óengus?” “It is likely that I am,” he replied. “Do not kill your sister:  I shall allow her to come out to you.” “That is well with us,” the young men said. With that Óengus stripped the shawl from the woman, put it about his own head and so made his way past them. *With that, they attacked the hut and killed the person inside it. Then he called from behind them: “I will make you regret that now,” he said. “You have killed my wife and your own sister.”* Then he set upon the men and slaughtered them. Afterwards Óengus and Aithechda made peace."

Tháinig fear an ghoirt roimhe chun Aena agus do ghabh sé an rann: “Do mac Laígse ba mór gó . in aenchenn ar in cét mbó; in mór do dul ar in mbec . in fubann in tsacairbec” “Is fuba imorro” ol Aena: “ní iarrubsa fortsa acht aenbhó.” ro búi dana a leithéite sin co meinic itir Aena ocus Colmán.,"The churl came to Aena, and delivered the quatrain:— “Great falsehood [i.e. an iniquitous award] it was for mac Laígse that a single head [i.e. one animal] should be made to represent an hundred kine; that the much should pass in payment for the little *does that impair the sacred host (i.e. vitiate thy sacred profession)?”*“Verily,” Aena said, “it is an iniquity, and I will ask of thee but one cow.” Now this kind of thing often passed between Colmán and him."

One of the men present quickly tipped a pan *full* of embers into the eyes *and face* of Óengus and Aithechda thrust Óengus’s own spear into him *so that it went through him* and so killed him. Then, they stuck off his head and placed him on a bed with a cloak over his head. Dubchrón arrived on Dubglas, Óengus’s horse. “Get down, Dubchrón,” they all said. “No,” he replied, “Where is Óengus?” “Hush, *hush,* he is asleep — do not disturb him. Dismount and come over into the house.” “It is not likely that Óengus would rest unless I were watching over him. Remove the cloak from his face.” It was removed. “So it is true, Óengus,” he said: “Though it is white it befits the face, that has met with swordplay. The head of Óengus has passed through many hands.”"
