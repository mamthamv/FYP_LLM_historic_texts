Thence there arise great contentions and comparison of trophies between them, even between Conall and Cuchulinn and Loegaire. “Bring me,” said Conall, “the brain of Mesgegra, so that I may talk to the competing warriors.” At that time it was a custom with the men of Ulster to take the brains out of the head of every warrior whom they slew in single combat, and to mix lime with them, so that they were made into hard balls.

Then he rose and struck Mesgegra's head, splitting the brain from his head, and Concubur died immediately. Therefore, the Gaels say that Concubur was the first pagan to go to heaven in Ireland, because the blood that burst from his head was his baptism. And then Conall's soul was taken to hell until Christ met him at the time of the liberation of hell, and Christ took Conall's soul with him to heaven. The end.","And after that Conall said: “Men would know the limits of my power in fighting against the Jews through the crucifixion of Christ if I were near him.” Then he rose and went upon the battlefield and split the head of Mesgegra from his neck, and at once it burst to Conchobar. Thus the Gaels said that it was Conchobar who first ascended to heaven in Ireland, because the blood from his head was his baptism. And then the soul of Conall was taken to hell so that he might meet Christ at the time of the release from hell, and Christ brought Conall's soul to heaven. End."
