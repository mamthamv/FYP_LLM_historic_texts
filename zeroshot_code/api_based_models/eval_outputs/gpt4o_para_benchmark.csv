Delightful to me was it to behold  Suibhne—he whose tomb this is—at yonder  well.

I was delighted to see Suibhne, that is, the one who is in this grave over there at that well, that is, the Well of the Geilt is its name, for it is often that he would drink of its water and from it the well is named.

Numerous too on that cliff were the beautiful trees, heavy and rich with fruits numerous also the well-sheltered ivy-trees and heavy-topped apple-trees bending to the ground with the weight of their fruit; wild deer and hares and great, heavy swine were there also, likewise many fat seals that used to sleep on that cliff after coming from the main beyond.

One day he would go to Innis Bo Finne in west Connacht, another day to delightful Eas Ruaidh, another day to smooth, beautiful Sliabh Mis, another day to ever-chilly Benn Boirche, but go where he would each day, he would attend at vespers each night at Teach Moling. Moling ordered a collation for him for that hour, for he told his cook to give him some of each day's milking. Muirghil was her name; she was wife of Mongan, swineherd to Moling.

The herd's sister seeing that, came in and said to her brother: ‘You cowardly  creature, your wife is in yonder hedge with another  man,’ said she, The herd hearing that became jealous, and he rose suddenly and and and and angrily and seized a spear that was within on a rack and made for the madman. The madman's side was towards him as he was lying down eating his meal out of the cowdung. The herd made a thrust of the spear out of his hand at Suibhne and wounded him in the nipple of his left breast, so that the point went through him, breaking his back in two. (Some say that it is the point of a deer's horn the herd had placed under him in the spot where he used to take his drink out of the cowdung, that he fell on it and so met his death.)","A quarrel arose there between Muirghil and another woman in the milking yard, so that the other woman said: ‘It is worse for you,’ said she, ‘that you do not prefer another man and also that you do not prefer your own man to attend to you than the madman who has been visiting you this past year.’ The sister of the boy heard that and yet she did not tell anything until she saw Muirghil the next morning going to milk the cows with Suibhne to the milking yard that was near the hedge where she was. When the sister of the boy saw that, she came in and said to her brother: ‘Your wife is in that hedge over there with another man, you weakling,’ said she. The boy was seized with anger at hearing that, and he rose quickly in a rage and took a half-spear that was on a hook inside and went towards the madman. The madman was there with his side to him, lying down eating his meal from the milking yard. The boy then thrust the half-spear from his hand at him, so that it pierced through his left breast, breaking his back in two. The people say that it was a spear of wild help that the boy prepared for him, where he was drinking his drink from the milking yard, so that he fell upon it, and thus he died.","A quarrel arose between Muirghil and another woman in the milking yard, so that the other woman said: ‘It is worse for you,’ she said, ‘that you do not prefer another man and also that you do not prefer your own man to attend to you than the madman who has been visiting you this past year.’ The sister of the boy heard that and yet she did not tell anything until she saw Muirghil the next morning going to milk the cows with Suibhne to the milking yard that was near the fence where she was. When the boy's sister saw that, she came in and said to her brother: ‘Your wife is in that fence over there with another man, you weakling,’ she said. The boy was seized with anger at hearing that, and he rose quickly, furious, and took a half-spear that was on a hook inside and went towards the madman. The madman was there with his side to him, lying down eating his meal from the milking yard. The boy then thrust the half-spear from his hand at him, so that it pierced his left breast, breaking his back in two. They say that it was a spear of wild help that the boy had prepared, where he would drink his drink from the milking yard, so that he fell upon it, and thus he died.","A confrontation occurred there between Muirghil and another woman in the dairy, to which the other woman said: 'It is worse for you,' she said, 'that you do not prefer another man and also that you do not find your own man better to attend to you than the madman who has come to you this year.' The sister of the boy heard that and yet she did not tell anything until she saw Muirghil the next morning going to milk the cows with Suibhne to the nearby dairy. When the boy's sister saw that, she came in and said to her brother: 'Your wife is in that enclosure over there with another man, you foolish weakling,' she said. The boy was seized with jealousy on hearing this, and he rose up quickly in anger and took a half-spear that was on a hook inside and went towards the madman. The madman was there with his side to him, lying down eating his meal from the dairy. The boy then thrust the half-spear from his hand into him, piercing his left side so that it went through him, breaking his spine in two. The people say that it was a deer horn that the boy used instead, where he drank his drink from the dairy, and it struck him, and thus he died.","A conflict occurred between Muirghil and another woman in the milking-place, and the other woman said: 'You are worse off,' she said, 'because you neither prefer another man nor is your own man better at attending to you than the madman who has been visiting you this year past.' The boy's sister heard that, but she did not tell anything until she saw Muirghil the next morning going to milk the cows with Suibhne near the enclosure. When the boy's sister saw that, she came inside and said to her brother: 'Your wife is with another man in that enclosure, you feeble-minded weakling,' she said. The boy was embarrassed on hearing that, and rose quickly, angrily, and took a half-spear that was on a window inside and went in the direction of the madman. The madman was there, with his side against it, lying down eating his meal from the milking-place. The boy struck the madman with the half-spear he had in his hand, piercing the left side of Suibhne's chest, breaking his back in two places. It is said by people that it was a wild spear-thrust that the boy made at him, where he was drinking from the milking-place, and it was thus he died."

At that time it was revealed to Ronan that Suibhne had recovered his reason and that he was going to his country to abide among his folk; whereupon Ronan said: ‘I entreat the noble, almighty King that  that persecutor may not be able to approach the church  to persecute it again as he once did, and, until his  soul has parted from his body, may there be no help or  relief to him from the vengeance which God inflicted on  him in revenge for the dishonour done to His people, so  that no other like tyrant after him may inflict outrage  or dishonour on the Lord or on His people.’","Then a fit of sense came to him and he went on towards his country to take sides with his people and to be with them. It was revealed to Ronán at that time that Suibhne's sense had returned to him and that he was going to his country to stay among his people, so Ronán said: ‘I beseech the noble almighty King that he may not allow that madman to attack the church to seize it again as he did once before, and that the punishment God inflicted on him for his impiety towards his people may not be of any help or relief to him until his soul is separated from his body, because he will not give another rebirth to madness after him, to the injury or dishonor of the Lord, nor to his people at all.’","A fit of madness came upon him then and he went forth towards his country to turn away from his people and to be with them. It was revealed to Ronán at that time that Suibhne's senses had returned to him and that he was going to his country to stay among his people, so Ronán said: 'I beseech the noble almighty King that he may not allow that madman to approach the church to seize it again as he did once before, and that the punishment God placed upon him for his impiety towards his people may not be relieved or aided until his soul is separated from his body, for he will not give another opportunity to the madman after his death to commit violence or insult against the Lord or against his people either.'","Then a fit of sense came to him and he went on towards his country to make peace with his people and to be loved by them. It was revealed to Ronan at that time that Suibhne was coming to his senses and going towards his country to rest among his people, so Ronan said: ‘I beseech the noble almighty King that he may not allow that wretch to attack the church again as he did once before and that the punishment God inflicted on him for his disrespect towards his people may not be a help or relief to him until his soul is separated from his body, so that he may not have another opportunity to attack or offend the Lord, nor his people at all.’","A fit of madness came upon him then, and he went on towards his country to be with his people and was beloved by them. It was revealed to Ronan then that Suibhne had regained his senses and was going towards his country to stay among his people, so Ronan said: ‘I beseech the noble almighty King that he may not allow this madman to attack the church again as he did once before and that God’s punishment upon him for his defiance may be such that he will find no help or relief until his soul is separated from his body, for he will have no other rebirth of madness to assault again as he did in violation against the Lord, not against his people at all.’"

He placed his two feet on the two edges of the basket of the cless, and bared his sword, and put its point to her heart, saying: ‘Death over thee!’ said he, ‘Thy three wishes from me!’ said she, viz., ‘thy three wishes as thou canst utter them in one breath,’ ‘They shall be taken,’ said Cuchulaind. He then pledged her. Other versions say here Cuchulaind took Scathach with him to the shore, and lay with her there, and slept with her, and that it was then that she sang this, prophesying to him everything that would befal him, saying: ‘Welcome, oh [...]’ etc. But that is not told thus after this account.","Then Cú Chulainn went to where Scáthach was. He put his two feet on two boards of the narrow bed and unsheathed the sword and placed its point against his heart and said: ‘Death is certain!’ he said. ‘Three thrusts for you,’ she said, ‘before breath would come with you.’ ‘Let it be taken!’ said Cú Chulainn. Then he bound her. This is what some versions reckon here, that Cú Chulainn took Scáthach with him to the shore and met her there and slept with her, and it was there that he sang to her while foretelling everything that would happen, saying: ‘Indeed, O weary one’ and so on. But this is not reckoned in this version otherwise.","Then Cú Chulainn went to where Scáthach was. He placed his two feet on two points of the narrow bed and bared his sword and placed its point towards his heart and said: ‘Death is certain!’ he said. ‘Three deaths await you,’ she said, ‘if you come with me.’ ‘I will take them!’ said Cú Chulainn. Then he leaped upon her. This is how some accounts tell it, that Cú Chulainn took Scáthach with him to the shore and met her there and slept with her, and it was there that she prophesied to him everything that would happen, saying: ‘Behold, O warrior’ and so on. But this version is not considered the oldest account.","Then Cú Chulainn went to where Scáthach was. He put his two feet on two points of the feat of skill and bared the sword and placed its point against his heart and said: ‘Death is welcome!’ said he. ‘You will have three heartbeats,’ said she, ‘before breath leaves you.’ ‘Let it be!’ said Cú Chulainn. He assailed her then. This is one version of the story here, that Cú Chulainn took Scáthach with him to the shore and met her there and slept with her, and it was there that he chanted a prophecy to her of everything that would happen, and he said: ‘Greetings, O shadowy one’ and so on. But this version is not considered old otherwise.","Then Cú Chulainn leaped to where Scáthach was. He placed his two feet on the two sides of the plank and uncovered his sword and pointed its tip towards his heart and said: 'I will kill you!' said he. 'There are three watches against you,' she said, 'if you come at me.' 'I will take it!' said Cú Chulainn. He threw himself upon her then. This is the way another version of the story relates it, that Cú Chulainn brought Scáthach with him onto the shore and encountered her there and lay with her, and it was there she sang to him while foretelling everything that would be, and she said: 'Behold, you harrier of the foe,' etc. But this version is not generally recognized as the old one."

During the time that he was with Scathach and the husband of Uathach, her daughter, a certain famous man who lived in Munster, viz. Lugaid, son of Nos, son of Alamac, the renowned king, and fosterbrother of Cuchulaind, went eastward with twelve chariot-chiefs of the high kings of Munster, to woo twelve maidens of the men of Mac Rossa. All these were betrothed to men before. When Forgall the Wily heard this, he went to Tara, and said to Lugaid that the best maiden in Erinn, both in shape and chastity and handiwork, was living with him unmarried. Lugaid said it pleased him well. Then Forgall betrothed the maiden to the king; and the twelve daughters of the twelve lords of land in Bray besides to the twelve under-kings that were together with Lugaid.","Uathach slept with Cú Chulainn and Scáthach was not able to protect the warrior. At that time, he was with Scáthach and Uathach, her daughter, and then a certain nobleman from Munster, namely Lugaid son of Noí son of Alamach, the distinguished king, a foster-brother of Cú Chulainn, came. He claimed the land and twelve hostages from the Munstermen as a bride-price for the daughter of Niafer son of Rusa. He surpassed all the men before him. Then when he heard Forcall Monuch in that place, he went to Tara and said to Lugaid that he had the best daughter in Ireland in terms of beauty and lineage and skill. Lugaid said he was pleased with that. Then Forcall gave his daughter to the king and twelve daughters of the twelve chieftains besides from Brega as a bride-price, and they were together with Lugaid.","Uathach slept with Cú Chulainn and Scáthach did not prevent it concerning the warrior.

He claimed the land and twelve hostages from the Munstermen as a bride-price for the daughter of Niafer son of Rusa. He surpassed all men before him. Then when he heard Forcall Monuch in that, he set out for Tara and said to Lugaid that he had the most beautiful daughter in Ireland in terms of form and lineage and skill. Lugaid said that he was pleased with that. Then Forcall offered his daughter to the king and twelve daughters of the twelve noblemen besides from Brega as a single bride-price with Lugaid.","Uathach slept with Cú Chulainn and Scáthach did not prevent it concerning the warrior. At that time, he was with Scáthach and her company, Uathach her daughter, when a certain nobleman from Munster came, namely Lugaid son of Noí son of Alamach, the distinguished king, a foster-brother of Cú Chulainn. He sought a reward and twelve cows from the Munstermen as a dowry for marrying one of the twelve daughters of Níaidhfér son of Rusa. This was the custom among all men before him. Then when he heard Forcall Monuch in this matter, he went to Tara and said to Lugaid that he had the best daughter in Ireland in terms of beauty, family, and skill. Lugaid said he was pleased with this. Then Forcall offered his daughter to the king and twelve daughters of the twelve noblemen of Bregu as a reward that were together with Lugaid.","Uathach slept with Cú Chulainn, and Scáthach did not grant him combat over the warriors. At that time, he was with Scáthach and her household, and Uathach was her daughter, and then another nobleman came from Munster, namely Lugaid son of Nóis son of Alamach, the gentle king, a foster-brother of Cú Chulainn. He came from the west with fourteen claims over him for the marriage of the daughter of Nia Fer son of Rusa. He was the greatest of all the men before him. Then, when he heard of the Forcalle of the Plain, he set out for Temair and said to Lugaid that he had with him the finest daughter in Ireland, both in beauty and in lineage and in skill. Lugaid said he was pleased with this. Then Forcald gave his daughter to the king and twelve daughters of the twelve nobles as well, along with their property, to Lugaid."

Then the two hosts assembled to fight. Cuchulaind was put in bonds by Scathach, and a sleeping potion had been given him before, that he might not go to the battle lest anything should happen to him there. As a precaution (?) she did this. Then forthwith out of his sleep started Cuchulaind after an hour. While anybody else would have slept twenty-four hours with this sleeping potion, it was only one hour for him.","There was a battle against Scathach then in that time by other northern people and it was against them that Aife was queen. Then they gathered both forces to give the battle, so that Cú Chulainn went with Scathach and he performed feats and deeds of valor that had never been done before in battle, so that nothing was withstood there. For it was in common that he did this. Then Cú Chulainn awoke from his sleep after the first attack; for where it was usual for twenty-four men to drink the sleep drink and sleep, he alone did so then.","There was a battle against Scathach then in that time from other northern lands and it was against them that Aife was queen.

Then each side assembled forces to wage the battle, until Cú Chulainn and Scathach made a truce (i.e. they agreed) and Cú Chulainn lay down to sleep and it was forbidden to awaken him until he came to the battle, for nothing should happen there. Because of a covenant this was done. Cú Chulainn arose from his sleep at the end of the first watch; for while it was appropriate for a man of the first order to arise at the end of another's watch, it was a single occasion for him then."

Then went the three sons of Esse Enchinde, viz. Cire and Bire and Blaicne, three other warriors of Aife, and began combat against the two sons of Scathach. They went on the path of feats. Scathach uttered a sigh at this, for she knew not what would come of it, first, as there was no third man with her two sons against those three and then she was afraid of Aife, because, she was the hardest woman-warrior in the world. Then Cuchulaind went up to her two sons, and sprang on the path, and met them all three, and they fell by him.","Then went with two sons of Scathach from the battle against the three sons of Ilsuanaigh, namely Cuar, Cet, and Cruifne, they being three warriors of Aife.

Scathach sent a message to them, for she did not know what would happen to them. It was a great battle without the third grass with the two sons of Scathach against those three, and indeed Aife the warrior woman feared, for she was the most formidable woman in the world.

Then Aife shattered Cuchulaind's weapon so that his sword was no longer than his fist ‘Ah,’ cried he, ‘the charioteer of Aife and her two horses and her chariot have fallen down in the glen, and have all perished!’ At that Aife looked up. Then Cuchulaind approached her, seized her at her two breasts, took her on his back like a shoulder-load, and carried her with him to his own host. Then he threw her from him to the ground, and placed his bare sword over him.

Aife threw her weapons at Cú Chulainn, but he broke them so that her sword was no longer than a fist. Then Cú Chulainn said: ‘Look out!’ he said, ‘Aife's charioteer and her two horses have fallen into the valley and are all dead.’ Aife looked and Cú Chulainn seized her by the breasts and threw her over as if she were a sling stone, so that she fell to the ground and he stood over her with a drawn sword.

Aife then said she was pregnant and would bear a son. ‘Send him to Ireland in seven years,’ she said, ‘and give him a name.’ Cú Chulainn left a gold thumb ring with her and told her to send the boy to Ireland when the ring fit his finger, and said that his name would be Connla and told her not to reveal him to any man and not to let any man turn him from his path and not to engage in combat with any man.","Aife arranged a battle against Scathach.

'They are my three desires,' said he, 'hostages for Scathach without any retribution afterwards, friendship with me by night before her fortress, and that you bear me a son.'

'He shall come after you in seven years to Ireland,' said she, 'and leave your name to him.' Cu Chulainn left a ring of gold with her and said to her that he would come to Ireland when the ring fit his finger and said that his name would be Conla and told her not to reveal his name to any man and not to turn any man from his path and not to refuse any unequal combat."

He met an old woman on the road who was blind of her left eye. She asked him to beware and not be on the road before her. He said there was no room for a footing for him save on the cliff of the sea which was beneath him. She besought him to leave the road to her. Then he left the road except that his toes clung to it. When she passed over him she hit his great toe to throw him off the path down the cliff. He noticed it and leapt the hero's salmon-leap up again, and struck the woman's head off. She was the mother of the three last warriors that had fallen by him, viz., Esse Enchinde, and in order to destroy him had come to meet him.","Then Cú Chulainn went with his people afterwards to rest, and this is what happened, on the first night. An old hag of the Tuatha Dé came upon him on the road. She told him to beware lest he should be on the road after nightfall. He said he would not be afraid of her unless she would rise up against him with the great fire that was under her. She asked him to let her pass by. He let her pass, but he kept his spear in his hand. As she was going past him, she struck his spear from his hand to the ground. He noticed this and turned quickly and struck her head from her body. She was the mother of the three warriors who were to be killed by him, namely, Ess Enchine, and he foresaw his own destruction coming upon him. Then they went into the forest with Scáthach to her own lands, and he took hostages from Aífe, and Cú Chulainn remained to recover there.","They came to Cu Chulainn with his people afterwards and this is what happened, on the first journey. An old blind woman met him on the path. He told her to move aside so that she would not be in front of him on the path. She said she would not move unless he lifted her over the great tree that was in front of her. He agreed to lift her over the tree. He lifted her from the path, but only with his little finger. As she went over, she struck his forehead with her staff and knocked him off the path. He realized what had happened and struck her with his sword, cutting off her head. She was the mother of the three warriors he had killed, namely Ess Enchine, and she had come to avenge them. Then they went into the forest with Scathach to her lands and Aife sent a challenge to him, and Cu Chulainn remained to recover there.","They came to Cu Chulainn with his people then, and this is what happened, on the first journey. An old blind woman met them on the path. She told him to take care not to be in front of her on the path. He said he would not be with her unless she would show him the way, except for the great tree that was under her. She asked him to leave the path for her. He left the path but kept his finger on the string only. When she passed by, she raised her staff to take the string off the tree. He noticed this and, with a skillful blow, he cut off the old woman's head. She was the mother of the three warriors whom he had slain, namely Ess Enchine, and she had come to avenge them. Then they went to the forest with Scathach to her lands and took hostages from Aife, and Cu Chulainn remained to recover there.","Then Cú Chulainn went with his people afterwards on this night, and he came on the first path. He met an old gray-haired woman on the path ahead of him. She said to him that he should not proceed, for she would be ahead of him on the path. He said that he had no place to go except by the great tree that was there. He asked her to let him pass by the path. He passed under the tree, but a twig caught in his hand only. As he was going up, he felt his own staff slipping from the tree. He noticed that and set off in a rush, and struck the head from the old woman. She was the mother of the three youths who had come against him, namely Ess Enchine, and then he completed what he had begun. Then they went into the forest with Scáthach to her lands and received a challenge from Aife, and Cú Chulainn remained to recover there."

Cuchulaind put a stone in his sling and aimed at the birds. The men ran up to them after having hit one of the birds. When they came up to them this is what they saw, two women, the most beautiful in the world. These were Derbforgaill, the daughter of Ruad, and her handmaid. ‘Evil is the deed thou hast done, oh Cuchulaind,’ said she. ‘It was to meet thee we came, though thou hast hurt us.’ Cuchulaind sucked the stone out    of her with its clot of blood round it. ‘I shall not wed thee now,’ said Cuchulaind, ‘for I have drunk thy blood. But I shall give thee to my companion here, viz., to Lugaid of the Red Stripes.’ And it was done thus.","When they were at the edge of Loch Cuan, they saw two birds on the sea. Cú Chulainn threw a stone at them and struck one of the birds. Then the men ran to him after hitting the other bird. When they arrived, they saw that they were two women in the same form on the earth. It was Derbforgaill, daughter of Ruad, and her maid. ‘It is a bad deed you have done, Cú Chulainn!’ she said. ‘We came to seek you, though it has tormented us.’ Cú Chulainn sat down the stone with its hidden edge around it. ‘I will not fight with you,’ said Cú Chulainn, ‘lest your blood be shed. I will give you to my foster-son here, namely to Lugaid Redstripe.’ And so it was done.","When they were at the edge of Loch Cuan, they then saw two birds on the sea.

It was Derbforgaill, daughter of Ruad, and her maid. ‘The deed you have done is bad, Cú Chulainn!’ she said. ‘We came to seek you, though we have been tormented.’ Cú Chulainn placed the stone from his sling with its hidden loop around it. ‘I will not fight with you,’ said Cú Chulainn, ‘for your blood will be shed. My fosterling will take you here, that is, Lugaid Redstripe.’ And so it was done.","When they were by the shore of Loch Cuan, they saw two birds on the sea.

'It is to seek you we have come, though we have been tormented.' Cú Chulainn sat the stone from him with its sharp edge around it. 'I will not strike against you again,' said Cú Chulainn, 'lest I spill your blood. Bring my fosterling here, that is, Lugaid Reo nderc.'

And he dealt three blows in the liss, so that eight men fell from each blow, and one man escaped in the midst of each group of nine, viz., Scibur and Ibur and Cat, three brothers of Emer. Forgall then made a leap on to the rampart of the rath without, in fleeing from Cuchulaind, and he fell and was without life. Cuchulaind took Emer with him and her foster-sister, with their two loads of gold and silver, and took a leap back again across the third rampart with the two maidens and went forth.","They reached the fort of Forcall and under the protection of the warriors there until they were within three enclosures of the fort, and there were three blows in the enclosure with eight men in each blow and one man in the middle of each group of nine, namely Scibar, Ipur, and Cat, the three brothers of Emer.

So hence it is called Crúfoit, viz., Cró-fót i.e., Turf of Blood. The pursuers overtook them at Ath n-Imfúait on the Boyne. Emer left the chariot. Cuchulaind made a chase on the shore, so that the clods flew from the hoofs of the horses across the ford northward.

Cu Chulainn took a wave of pursuit so that the sods of the horses' hooves flew northward over the ford.

Cridenbel thought his own share was small and the Dagda's share was large. He said, 'O Dagda, give me the best third of your share.' So the Dagda gave it to him each night. However, the measure of the satirist's share, which was the size of a good pig, was that share. But a third of the Dagda's share was those three measures. The Dagda's blossom from that was excessive."
