Delightful to me was it to behold  Suibhne—he whose tomb this is—at yonder  well.

Dear, too, every other place  that Suibhne used to frequent’; whereupon Moling said:","I came urgently to visit Suibhne, and Moling rose up with clerics as one with him, and gave a stone to every man in Suibhne’s territory. ‘Wonderful and strange is the man who is in this place,’ said Moling, ‘I think it is a wonder that we are safe and sound conversing with another beyond the danger of this hunting. It was delightful to me to see Suibhne, namely, here in this place on that height over there, namely, Tiupra, the height of Gealta, is its name, for often it is not found whether God will strike or bless, and it is a high-named height.

Numerous too on that cliff were the beautiful trees, heavy and rich with fruits numerous also the well-sheltered ivy-trees and heavy-topped apple-trees bending to the ground with the weight of their fruit; wild deer and hares and great, heavy swine were there also, likewise many fat seals that used to sleep on that cliff after coming from the main beyond.

One day he would go to Innis Bo Finne in west Connacht, another day to delightful Eas Ruaidh, another day to smooth, beautiful Sliabh Mis, another day to ever-chilly Benn Boirche, but go where he would each day, he would attend at vespers each night at Teach Moling. Moling ordered a collation for him for that hour, for he told his cook to give him some of each day's milking. Muirghil was her name; she was wife of Mongan, swineherd to Moling. This was the extent of the meal the woman used to give him: she used to thrust her heel up to her ankle in the cowdung nearest her and leave the full of it of new milk there for Suibhne. He used to come cautiously and carefully into the vacant portion of the milking yard to drink the milk.","I took the hostages then; they spent that year coming to Moling.

Moling ordered a plentiful crop for him at that time, so that he spoke to a woman, saying she should not refuse the cows to be given to him. Muirghil was her name, and she was the wife of Mungán, whom Moling fostered. She was the portion of that crop which he inherited from the woman, that is, she did not diminish his share of it, and she left a full measure of prosperity there for Suibhne. It was then that a strange, wonderful occurrence happened in the intergrowth of the cattle-folds, concerning the milk of those cows.","I took the hostages then; they spent that year coming to Moling.

The herd's sister seeing that, came in and said to her brother: ‘You cowardly  creature, your wife is in yonder hedge with another  man,’ said she, The herd hearing that became jealous, and he rose suddenly and and and and angrily and seized a spear that was within on a rack and made for the madman. The madman's side was towards him as he was lying down eating his meal out of the cowdung. The herd made a thrust of the spear out of his hand at Suibhne and wounded him in the nipple of his left breast, so that the point went through him, breaking his back in two. (Some say that it is the point of a deer's horn the herd had placed under him in the spot where he used to take his drink out of the cowdung, that he fell on it and so met his death.)","It happened that a transgression was committed there between Muirghil and a learned woman in the milking shed, so that the other woman said: ‘Woe to you,’ she said, ‘that you do not take another man and still do not let your own man suffice for your need of the wealth that has been given to him this year.’ The young man’s sister was angered by that, and she did not reveal to anyone who would see Muirghil in the morning going to milk the cows to Suibhne, who was close to the milking shed and accustomed to the field. Because of the young man’s sister’s observation, she came in and said to her brother: ‘Your woman is in that field with a learned man, you poor, unfortunate man,’ she said. The boy went at the sound of it, and he raged with inner fury and drew his sword halfway out of its scabbard and went out after the wealth. And thus the wealth and everything around it lay, and he was lying, tearing his groin in the milking shed. He gave the young man enough of the scabbard from his hand, so that his bones cracked on both sides of him before Suibhne, so that one could break his back in two through it. A wild, thorny bush received the boy beneath, a place where his blood was spilled in the milking shed, until he was completely still, and thus he died.","It happened that a transgression was committed there between Muirghil and a learned woman in the milking shed, so that the other woman said: ‘Woe to you,’ she said, ‘that you do not take another man and still do not let your own man suffice for your need of the wealth that has been obtained with him this year.’ The young man’s sister was angered by that, and she did not reveal to anyone who would see Muirghil in the morning going to milk the cows to Suibhne, who was close to the milking shed and accustomed to the field. Because of the young man’s sister’s observation, she came in and said to her brother: ‘Your woman is in that field with a learned man, you poor, unfortunate man,’ she said. The young man went at the sound of it, and he raged with inner fury and drew his sword halfway out of its scabbard and went out after the wealth. And thus the wealth and all around it lay, and he was lying, tearing his groin in the milking shed. He gave the young man enough of the scabbard from his hand, so that his side was seen clearly by Suibhne, so that he could break his back in two with it. He spoke a fierce, wild word to the young man beneath him, a place where his seed was spilled in the milking shed, until he was completely still, and thus he died.","It happened that a transgression occurred there between Muirghil and a learned woman in the milking shed, so that the other woman said: ‘Woe to you,’ she said, ‘that you do not take another man and still do not let your own man suffice for your need of the wealth that has been obtained with him this year.’ The young man heard of the incident then, and he was greatly angered and drew his left hand for striking inwards and went out of the milking shed. And thus the woman was and beside her, lying and tearing her clothing in the milking shed. The young man gave a blow with his left hand, so that he split her back in two at Suibhne, so that one could see through the breaking of her spine. She fell face down, and the young man knelt over her, a place where her blood flowed in the milking shed, until she was quite cold, and thus she died.","It happened, a suitable death occurred there between Muirghil and a learned woman in the milking place, so that the other woman said: ‘It is worse for you,’ she said, ‘that you do not take another man and still do not let your own man suffice for your need of the wealth that is possessed with him this year onward.’ The young man’s sister was angered by that speech, and she did not reveal who would see Muirghil in the morning going to milk the cows to Suibhne, to the milking place that was close to the enclosure. Because of the young man’s sister’s anger, she came in and spoke to her brother: ‘Your woman is in that enclosure with a learned man, you foolish, unheroic one,’ she said. The boy went at hearing that, and he rose up inwardly and drew his left hand for a weapon inward and went out from the enclosure. Thus he was near the enclosure and beside it, lying and tearing his entrails in the milking place. He gave the young man help from the hand that was left, so that he split his back in two at that place before Suibhne, so that he could break his back in two there. A wild, thorny bush fell upon the boy beneath, a place where his blood was spilled in the milking place, until he was completely still, and thus he died."

At that time it was revealed to Ronan that Suibhne had recovered his reason and that he was going to his country to abide among his folk; whereupon Ronan said: ‘I entreat the noble, almighty King that  that persecutor may not be able to approach the church  to persecute it again as he once did, and, until his  soul has parted from his body, may there be no help or  relief to him from the vengeance which God inflicted on  him in revenge for the dishonour done to His people, so  that no other like tyrant after him may inflict outrage  or dishonour on the Lord or on His people.’","He came to his sense there, and set out quickly to his country to aid his people and to relieve their distress. Ronan revealed to him then the meaning, so that Suibhne understood, and went to his country to kindle zeal for his people, until Ronan said: ‘I beseech the noble, all-powerful King that He may not permit that torment to attack the weakness of His covenant, nor a harsh judgment upon them, and the creation that God made for their redemption and purification from their sins, nor exile nor destruction for them, but may He restore his soul to his body, for surely his noble learning is a torment of God’s covenant, or a lessening for the Community that is not for his people.’","He came to his sense there, and set out quickly to his country to aid his people and to relieve their distress.

When he came among them he heard them talking to each other, and this is what they were saying: ‘He is a  madman,’ said the first head; ‘a madman of  Ulster,’ said the second head; ‘follow him  well,’ said the third head; ‘may the pursuit be  long,’ said the fourth head; ‘until he reaches  the sea,’ said the fifth head. They rose forth together towards him. He soared aloft in front of them (passing) from thicket to thicket, and no matter how vast was the glen before him he would not touch it, but would leap from one edge of it to another, and from the summit of one hill to the summit of another.","May God prosper you, Ronan, when suddenly came Suibhne to the middle of Slieve Fuad, and he steadied his foot there with a great increase of phantom-visions of wonder to him in the middle of the night. That is, fifty pale heads without bodies and without limbs, moving and leaping along the narrow path hither and thither. Suddenly they began to converse with each other, and it was their utterance: ‘It is a fault,’ said the first head. ‘An Ulster fault,’ said the second head. ‘It is good to be lenient,’ said the third head. ‘May leniency be long-lasting,’ said the fourth head. ‘Or may the sea be better,’ said the fifth head. He turned his loneliness towards them. Rouse yourselves! For every vein of his body and a great glen newly opened before him, he would not find it, but only a board for his body and the peaks of the hills for his support.","May God prosper you, Ronan, when suddenly came Suibhne to the middle of Slieve Fuaid, and he steadied his foot there with a great increase of phantom-visions of wonder to him in the middle of the night, namely, a multitude of pale heads without bodies and without limbs, moving and leaping along the narrow path hither and thither.

Thirty feet was the height of each bronze front that was in the house. Carvings of red yew were therein. It was a board [...] below, and a roof of tiles above. The bed of Conchobor was in the front of the house, with boards of silver, with pillars of bronze, with the glitter of gold on their head-pieces, and carbuncles in them, so that day and night were equally light in it, with its silver board above the king to the highest part of the royal house. Whenever Conchobor struck the board with a royal rod, all the men of Ulster were silent thereat. The twelve beds of the twelve chariot-chiefs were round about that bed.","He was a noble champion who was in that place, a lord in Craebruad of Concobor, under the hardship of the house of Midhcordai. No escape from death for a warrior. Three times a shield is raised against every violent belief that enters the house. A harsh judgement upon them. A blow on his shield, he is not slain, and a wound on his head. Concobor entered the house with the hosts of the world, with a belief that would not fail, with a multitude before his armies, with great prosperity among them, with complete peace and welcome within, without a hostile force above the king with high right. Concobor did not boast of the strength of his shield, the men of Ulster all knew it. Two days he spent in his error, two days he was without food, until he surrounded him.","He was a noble champion who was in that place, a lord in Craebruad of Concobor, under the hardship of the house of Midhcordai.

Splendid, lavish, and beautiful were the valiant warriors of the men of Ulster in that house. There were great and numerous gatherings of every kind in that house, and wonderful pastimes.

It was a great marvel, a maiden unwilling to go to the men of Ulster, to the assembly of Emain Macha. It happened, a wretched, twisted deed of kingship, and of violent deeds.

This was the drinking of the 'coal' that would satisfy all the men of Ulster at one time. The chariot-chiefs of Ulster were performing on ropes stretched across from door to door in the house at Emain. Fifteen feet and nine score was the size of that house. The chariot-chiefs were performing three feats—viz., the spear-feat, and the apple-feat, and the sword-edge feat.","They say that the men of Ulster were warriors not peaceful around Emain Macha, each with a spear in his hand. A hundred were killed and a score taken captive. It was a custom to steal cattle. And they plundered the province of Ulster widely. They did not sleep around Emain Macha on the night of the battle. Five escaped that night, fleeing from the house. Three lights were seen on the plain, namely, a light of smithing and a light of baking and a light of brewing.","The men who were in the fortress of Emain Macha were warriors, and they were not idle. It is fitting that a skilled man should not be without weapons. It was a custom to have arms. And it is a necessity for Ulster to have readiness. They did not leave the fortress of Emain Macha on account of sleep or rest, nor to go outside the door for any kingly purpose. Five troops went forth at night to make sport around the house. Three lights were kindled for the troops, namely, a bright light and a light of apples and a light of embers.","The men who were in the fortress of Emain Macha were warriors, and they were not idle. It is fitting that those who are skilled should not be without practice in every art. It is a shame for a man to be unskilled. Truly, Ulster is not lacking in noble warriors.

Three weapons were brought to the fortress, namely, a shield, a spear, and a sword.","The men who were in the fortress of Emain Macha were warriors, and they were not peaceful.

The women of Ulster loved Cuchulaind greatly for his quickness at the feats, for the nimbleness of his leap, for the excellency of his wisdom; for the sweetness of his speech, for the beauty of his face, for the loveliness of his look. For there were seven pupils in his kingly eyes, four of them in his one eye, and three of them in the other. He had seven fingers on either hand, and seven toes on either of his two feet. Many were his gifts. First, his gift of prudence until his warrior's flame appeared, the gift of feats, the gift of buanfach,6 the gift of draught-playing, the gift of calculating, the gift of sooth-saying, the gift of sense, the gift of beauty.

Cu Chulaind spoke, but a daughter who was equal to him in age and form and lineage and skill and appearance was not found, so that he tested all the daughters of Ireland and none surpassed him nor was comparable to him in the provinces of Ireland in any art. And it is from this opening that the stories are told. And it is right that this beauty is renowned throughout Ireland for Cu Chulaind."

He placed his two feet on the two edges of the basket of the cless, and bared his sword, and put its point to her heart, saying: ‘Death over thee!’ said he, ‘Thy three wishes from me!’ said she, viz., ‘thy three wishes as thou canst utter them in one breath,’ ‘They shall be taken,’ said Cuchulaind. He then pledged her. Other versions say here Cuchulaind took Scathach with him to the shore, and lay with her there, and slept with her, and that it was then that she sang this, prophesying to him everything that would befal him, saying: ‘Welcome, oh [...]’ etc. But that is not told thus after this account.","Loud was the cry of Cú Chulainn when he struck the cow Scáthach. He carried her and her calves over two boards, a grey cloak and a dark mantle, and a judgement he made under the shadow of his heart and spoke: ‘Death to the wretched!’ said he. ‘Three drops of venom to you,’ she said, ‘have poisoned your breath.’ ‘Enough!’ said Cú Chulainn. Under a cloud of fury he was then. It was another cruel slaughter here, so rushed Cú Chulainn at Scáthach’s host with that attack and with fierce conflict among them and with great skill in his attack, until he caused every man to fall around him, and he spoke: ‘Burn, you wretched ones!’ and so on. But it is not remembered now that such a deed was ever evil.","Loud was the cry of Cú Chulainn when he struck the cow Scáthach.

Under a cloud of fury he was then. It was another sharp wound here, so that Cú Chulainn struck Scáthach’s side with it and battled with her and was well-content in his fighting, until he caused every limb of her to be broken, so that he spoke: ‘Burn, you wicked woman!’ and so on.

During the time that he was with Scathach and the husband of Uathach, her daughter, a certain famous man who lived in Munster, viz. Lugaid, son of Nos, son of Alamac, the renowned king, and fosterbrother of Cuchulaind, went eastward with twelve chariot-chiefs of the high kings of Munster, to woo twelve maidens of the men of Mac Rossa. All these were betrothed to men before. When Forgall the Wily heard this, he went to Tara, and said to Lugaid that the best maiden in Erinn, both in shape and chastity and handiwork, was living with him unmarried. Lugaid said it pleased him well. Then Forgall betrothed the maiden to the king; and the twelve daughters of the twelve lords of land in Bray besides to the twelve under-kings that were together with Lugaid.","Uathach went to the peak of Culaind and Scáthach eagerly welcomed the noble warrior.

He demanded two hostages and two portions of land from the men of Munster as a bride-price for the two daughters of Níaidhfér son of Rus. He was then a fierce man among the valiant. After that, Forcall of the Monuch spoke to him, promising him to the women of Temair and hinting to Lugaid about the beautiful daughter who was in Ireland, of perfect form and lineage and beauty. Lugaid thought it was good to hear that.

Then the two hosts assembled to fight. Cuchulaind was put in bonds by Scathach, and a sleeping potion had been given him before, that he might not go to the battle lest anything should happen to him there. As a precaution (?) she did this. Then forthwith out of his sleep started Cuchulaind after an hour. While anybody else would have slept twenty-four hours with this sleeping potion, it was only one hour for him.","It was fitting for Scathach to teach her skills at that time, freely to warriors both great and small, and it was for this reason that Banflaith, daughter of Aife, was with her. She had requested a quarter of the teaching to be given to the captive, so that Scathach and Cú Chulainn might be equal; and she wished for fairness and a just share for her son, who had never been in battle or war. It was by this agreement that the deed was done.

Then went the three sons of Esse Enchinde, viz. Cire and Bire and Blaicne, three other warriors of Aife, and began combat against the two sons of Scathach. They went on the path of feats.

Then Aife shattered Cuchulaind's weapon so that his sword was no longer than his fist ‘Ah,’ cried he, ‘the charioteer of Aife and her two horses and her chariot have fallen down in the glen, and have all perished!’ At that Aife looked up.

Afterwards, Aiffi said she was pregnant and with a son who would be unmatched. “He will rule Ireland for seven years,” she said, “and you will know his name.” Cú Chulaind saw a golden chain and asked what it was, and was told it was a chain to bind him to Ireland until the end of his days, and that his name would be known to every judge, and that no woman would refuse him passage or obstruct his path, nor would anyone challenge his right.","Scathach challenged Cú Chulaind to a contest with Aiffi.

Then Cú Chulaind said, ‘It is wrong!’ and he said, ‘you have deceived Aife and her two beautiful breasts under her cloak,’ and he struck her. Aife then retreated. Cú Chulaind pursued her and seized her two cheeks and pushed her across the water, attempting to weaken Cú Chulaind with her magic, but she could not harm him, and she threw her sword far away. Aife said, ‘My soul, Cú Chulaind!’ and she said, ‘My three kisses for you!’ He said, ‘You will not be free or safe until you give me your three kisses,’ and he said, ‘they are three kisses for Scathach, so that you will not betray her again, and a winter’s journey for you to the islands of the fierce, and with the son you bear.’ ‘I agree to that,’ she said, ‘you will find me for this.’ Cú Chulaind then went with Aife and completed that deed. Afterwards, Aife said she was pregnant and with a son who would be famous. ‘He will rule Ireland for seven years,’ she said, ‘and you will know his name.’ Cú Chulaind accepted a pledge from her, and said he would not allow him to come to Ireland until the day he would need his help, and he said he would know his name by his judgment in a dispute, and he said she would not refuse him hospitality or hinder him on his path, nor would she conceal his birth."

He met an old woman on the road who was blind of her left eye. She asked him to beware and not be on the road before her. He said there was no room for a footing for him save on the cliff of the sea which was beneath him. She besought him to leave the road to her. Then he left the road except that his toes clung to it. When she passed over him she hit his great toe to throw him off the path down the cliff. He noticed it and leapt the hero's salmon-leap up again, and struck the woman's head off. She was the mother of the three last warriors that had fallen by him, viz., Esse Enchinde, and in order to destroy him had come to meet him.","At Cuailnge were hounds with a western people, skilled and it was thus they came, for the hosting of the hundred. With what skill did the tribesmen make their heads for the hosting? Atbert was a free man, a noble warrior, over the men for their heads in the hosting. Aspert was not wont to seek strife except by the great sea that was before him. He sought the path to be given to him by God. He did not deem it good to be without his warriors, lest his name be forgotten. Let those vassals be ready to obey his command for the sake of the hosting, for the sake of the great age that was. He recounted the signs and the deeds that were not hidden, and spoke of the benefits and blessings of his lineage. She was the mother of three hundred noble warriors, skilled in all arts, namely Ess Enchine, and she fostered her fosterlings on her knee. Afterwards the host went to Sluaige with Scathach for the sake of skill and to test the young warriors from Aífe and the feats of Cú Chulainn were a delight to all.","At Cuailnge were complaints about the men of the west, and it was thus it happened, for the sake of a hundred cows. With what skill did the men of Ulster act for their heads for that deed? Atbert was a free man who often spoke of the things for their heads, yesterday. Aspert said that it was not right for him to attempt a prophecy except by the great old age that was in him. He sought the way to be given to him by God. He did not value a single cow except for the sake of his people’s honour. Let the vassals of the forest obey your command to give a cow for every year of old age. It is said that he had no daughter who was a skilled woman, and who would not be a vassal to a skilled woman and would not lose her honour. She was the mother of three hundred noble warriors, a learned woman, namely Ess Enchine, and she accepted her share. Afterwards the host went to Sluaige with Scathach for the sake of training and to obtain knowledge from Aifi and the deeds of Cu Chulainn were a source of glory in battle.","At Cuailnge were complaints about the men of the west, and it was thus it happened, for the sake of a hundred cows.

Let not his vassals forget his command to give a share of the land for the sake of God. It is said that he had no daughter who was not honoured, and blessed was her offspring.

Thereafter Cuchulaind came to the dun like every other guest. Then Conall and Loegaire welcomed him. Many in the dun boasted of having killed the Fomori, but the maiden did not believe them. A bath was then prepared by the king, and each one was brought to her separately. Then Cuchulaind came like everybody else, and the maiden recognized him, ‘I shall give the maiden to thee.’ said Ruad, ‘and I shall pay her wedding-gift myself.’ ‘Not so,’ said Cuchulaind. ‘Let her come this day year to Erinn after me, if it be pleasant to her, and she will find me there.’","The maiden was taken from the fortress, and a pledge was made by her father regarding her news. Cú Chulainn took the maiden from the fortress, a pearl like every young girl. Welcome was offered to him by Conall and Lægair.

Cuchulaind put a stone in his sling and aimed at the birds. The men ran up to them after having hit one of the birds. When they came up to them this is what they saw, two women, the most beautiful in the world. These were Derbforgaill, the daughter of Ruad, and her handmaid. ‘Evil is the deed thou hast done, oh Cuchulaind,’ said she. ‘It was to meet thee we came, though thou hast hurt us.’ Cuchulaind sucked the stone out    of her with its clot of blood round it. ‘I shall not wed thee now,’ said Cuchulaind, ‘for I have drunk thy blood.

Cu Chulaind killed a hundred men there. ‘Great is the valley you have chosen,’ said Emer, ‘a hundred men unarmed and uncomplaining to be killed.’ ‘Glonnath will be its name forever,’ said Cu Chulaind.","The fort of Forcall was plundered, and by my oath, it was not right to leave three lives for a single one, for the sake of a man, and let three scores be taken for each score lost, and a man in the middle for every non-noble. That is, Scibar and Ipur and Cat, three brothers of Eimer. By the deed of Forcall, it is not right to go beyond the boundaries of the fort for the sake of the boasting of Con Culaind, until they fall into a snare without souls. To the burial of Cu Chulaind, Eimer came with those who would contend with his enemies, both near and far, and by the deed of that oath, it is not right to go beyond the boundaries of the third of the land with his non-noble offspring and a generous reward. A watcher for every height. May Scenmend be with them. Cu Chulaind killed him at his ford, and he gave his fierce cry at the ford of Scenmend. He took hostages to Glonnath. Cu Chulaind killed a hundred non-nobles there. ‘Great is the valley you have chosen,’ said Emer, ‘a hundred men unarmed and uncomplaining to be killed.’ ‘Glonnath will be its name forever,’ said Cu Chulaind."

He dealt great angry blows on the hosts in that place, so that the streams of blood broke over it on each side. ‘The height is a turf of blood through thee today, oh Cuchulaind.’ cried the maiden. So hence it is called Crúfoit, viz., Cró-fót i.e., Turf of Blood. The pursuers overtook them at Ath n-Imfúait on the Boyne. Emer left the chariot. Cuchulaind made a chase on the shore, so that the clods flew from the hoofs of the horses across the ford northward. He made another chase northward so that the clods flew from the hoofs of the horses over the ford southward.

Emer was brought into the    Red Branch to Conchobor and to the men of Ulster, and they bade her welcome. There was a grim evil-tongued man of the men of Ulster in the house, viz., Bricriu of the Venomous Tongue, the son of Arba. It was then he said: ‘Forsooth, it will be disagreeable to Cuchulaind what will happen to-night, viz., the woman whom he brought with him will sleep with Conchobor. For with him is the deflowering of virgins before the men of Ulster ever.’ Cuchulaind grew mad when he heard that, and shook himself so that the cushion burst which was under him, and its feathers were flying about the house. He went out then.","It is said that the cause of the death of Cú Chulainn was a hundred men for each ford from Áth Scenmenn to Ollbine to Boind of Breg and they were constantly at that deed, until the daughter was angered and she went safe afterwards. When Emvin Machai heard of that deed, he was angered. Eimeur and Cræbruaidh Concopuir with the warriors of Ulster came and offered hospitality. A man spoke, saying, ‘Be wary of me,’ he said, ‘for Cú Chulainn will be killed tonight and tomorrow you will be at his funeral with Concopar tonight, for it is less than a hundred maidens for the Ulstermen to ransom.’ Then Cú Chulainn heard that and at the sound of it he rose up and went to meet the host, and he went out quickly.","It is said that the cause of the death of Cú Chulainn was a hundred men for each ford from Ath Scenmenn to Ollbine to Boind of Breg and all the deeds of that time were wrought by the young men, and it will be well thereafter. For when Emvin Machai saw the fire in that place, Eimeur, daughter of Cræbruaidh Concopuir, with the warriors of Ulster, came and offered hospitality. A man came to Ulster to boast, namely, Bricne Nemtengai, son of Carbad. He said and spoke thus: ‘Be wary of me,’ he said, ‘for Cú Chulainn will be slain tonight, and tomorrow you will be at his funeral with Concopar tonight, for it is less trouble to kill a hundred maidens than to contend with the men of Ulster.’ Then Cú Chulainn heard that speech and rose in wrath, and he went forth to meet the challenge, and he went out swiftly.","It is said that the cause of the death of Cú Chulainn was a hundred men for each ford from Ath Scenmenn to Ollbine to Boind of Breg and they were constantly at that deed, a great destruction for the princess and she will be safe afterwards, after the agreement of Emvin Machai, who was in that place. Eimeur, daughter of Cræbruaidh Concopuir, with the warriors of Ulster, welcomed and honoured them. There was a man who boasted to the Ulstermen, namely, Bricne Nemtengai, son of Carbad.

Then his wrath had departed from him.","“A great burden is on us,” said Cathbad, “but it is a taboo for a king to refuse Bricne’s request.
