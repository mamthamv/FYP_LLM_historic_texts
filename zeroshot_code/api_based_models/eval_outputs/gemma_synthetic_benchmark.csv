Thence there arise great contentions and comparison of trophies between them, even between Conall and Cuchulinn and Loegaire. “Bring me,” said Conall, “the brain of Mesgegra, so that I may talk to the competing warriors.” At that time it was a custom with the men of Ulster to take the brains out of the head of every warrior whom they slew in single combat, and to mix lime with them, so that they were made into hard balls. And whenever they were in contention or at comparison of trophies, these were brought to them, so that they had them in their hands.","A great feast was made for the men of Ulster to meet in Slieve Fuaid. A record was made of a great gathering and of a convention, namely, between Connall and Conculainn and Lóegaire. “I have,” said Connall, “the right of Messgra as was granted to me by the conventions.” It was a custom with the Ulstermen in that attack that every champion who was not a single combatant would be taken captive and mixed with noble women so that they would make hard balls of them.

"“Maith, a Conall,” ar Chonchobuir, “na co ndernat óic na comram écht fón innas-[s]a ar galaib óinfhir, nídat túalngi comram frim-sa.” “Is fir ón,” ar Conall.","“Well, O Conall,” said Chonchobuir, “until the competing warriors perform a deed like this in single combat, they are not capable of comparing trophies with me.” “That is true,” said Conall.","Good, Conall,” said Conchobhar, “whoever did the deed of this hosting is not a lawful host for us.

Then the men of Connaught came up from the other side to rescue him. A battle is fought between them. Conall himself went into the battle. And it was then that the women of Connaught begged Conall to come aside so that they might see his shape. For there was not on earth the shape of a human being like the shape of Conchobar, both for beauty and figure and dress, for size and symmetry and proportion, for eye and hair and whiteness, for wisdom and manners and eloquence, for raiment and nobleness and equipment, for weapons and wealth and dignity, for bearing and valour and race. That Conall was faultless indeed. However, it was by the advice of Cet that the women importuned Conchobar. Then he went aside alone to be seen by the women.","Fecht and constantly flourished the dwellings of Cet before the cattle of the Fir Bolg came to Ireland.

It is said there was no land-portion like the portion of Conchubur, namely, between truth and skill and hospitality, between wine and food and brightness, between speech and justice and counsel, between redness and whiteness and purity, between slaughter and honour and revenge, between weapons and praise and judgment, between beauty and valour and kinship.
