Delightful to me was it to behold  Suibhne—he whose tomb this is—at yonder  well. The Madman's Well is its name, for often would he  eat of its watercress and drink its water, and (so) the  well is named after him. Dear, too, every other place  that Suibhne used to frequent’; whereupon Moling said:","Then a faintness came upon Suibhne, and Moling arose with his clerics along with him, and they placed a stone for each man on Suibhne's grave.

It was delightful for me to see Suibhne, that is, the one whose grave this is, at that well yonder, 'Well of the Madmen' is its name, for often he would partake of its cress and its water, and from him it is named the well.

Numerous too on that cliff were the beautiful trees, heavy and rich with fruits numerous also the well-sheltered ivy-trees and heavy-topped apple-trees bending to the ground with the weight of their fruit; wild deer and hares and great, heavy swine were there also, likewise many fat seals that used to sleep on that cliff after coming from the main beyond.

The herd's sister seeing that, came in and said to her brother: ‘You cowardly  creature, your wife is in yonder hedge with another  man,’ said she, The herd hearing that became jealous, and he rose suddenly and and and and angrily and seized a spear that was within on a rack and made for the madman. The madman's side was towards him as he was lying down eating his meal out of the cowdung. The herd made a thrust of the spear out of his hand at Suibhne and wounded him in the nipple of his left breast, so that the point went through him, breaking his back in two. (Some say that it is the point of a deer's horn the herd had placed under him in the spot where he used to take his drink out of the cowdung, that he fell on it and so met his death.)","A dispute arose one night between Muirghil and another woman in the milking-fold, and the other woman said: 'It is worse for you,' she said, 'that you do not prefer another man, and moreover, that you do not prefer your own man to come to you, rather than the madman who has been visiting you for the past year.' The herdsman's sister heard that, and yet she did not tell anything of it until she saw Muirghil on the morrow morning going to deliver milk to Suibhne to the dung-heap that was near the fence where he was. When the herdsman's sister saw that, she came in and said to her brother: 'Your wife is in that fence yonder with another man, you feeble, unmanly wretch,' she said. Jealousy seized the herdsman on hearing that, and he rose suddenly and furiously, and took in his hand a half-spear that was on a rack inside, and went towards the madman. Thus was the madman, with his side towards him and he lying, eating his meal from the dung-heap. The herdsman then gave a thrust with the half-spear from his hand at him, so that he wounded Suibhne in the dark part of his left breast, so that it passed through him, breaking his back in two there. Some say that it was a deer's antler that the herdsman had placed beneath him, where he used to drink his liquid from the dung-heap, so that he fell upon it, and thus he died.","A nightly quarrel occurred there between Muirghil and another woman in the milking-fold, so the other woman said: 'It is worse for you,' she said, 'that you do not prefer another man, and moreover, that you do not prefer your own man to come to you, rather than the madman who has been visiting you for the past year.' The herdsman's sister heard that, and yet she did not tell anything of it until she saw Muirghil on the following morning going to deliver milk to Suibhne, to the cow-dung heap that was nearest to the fence where he was. When the herdsman's sister saw that, she came in and said to her brother: 'Your wife is in that fence yonder with another man, you feeble, unwarlike wretch,' she said. The herdsman was seized with jealousy on hearing that, and he rose up suddenly and furiously, and seized a half-spear that was on a rack inside, and went towards the madman. The madman was thus, with his side towards him, and he lying down, eating his meal from the cow-dung heap. The herdsman then gave a thrust with the half-spear from his hand at him, so that he wounded Suibhne in the dark part of his left breast, so that it went through him, breaking his back in two there.

The herdsman's sister heard that, and yet she did not tell anything of it until she saw Muirghil on the following morning going to deliver the milk to Suibhne at the dung-heap that was near the fence where he was. When the herdsman's sister saw that, she came in and said to her brother: 'Your wife is over there at that fence with another man, you cowardly weakling,' she said. The herdsman became jealous on hearing that, and rose up suddenly in a rage, and seized a half-spear that was on a rack inside, and went towards the madman. The madman was in such a way, with his side towards him and he lying down, eating his meal from the dung-heap. Then the herdsman thrust the half-spear from his hand at him, so that it wounded Suibhne in the dark part of his left breast, and it went through him, breaking his back in two there.

The herdsman's sister heard that, and yet she did not tell of it until she saw Muirghil on the following morning going to deliver milk to Suibhne at the cow-dung heap that was near the fence where he was. When the herdsman's sister saw that, she came in and said to her brother: 'Your wife is in that fence yonder with another man, you wretched, unmanly fellow,' she said. The herdsman was seized with jealousy on hearing that, and he rose up suddenly and angrily, and took in his hand a half-spear that was on a rack inside, and went to attack the wild man. The wild man was lying with his side towards him, eating his meal from the cow-dung heap. Then the herdsman thrust the half-spear from his hand at him, so that it struck Suibhne in the hollow of his left breast, and went right through him, breaking his back in two places. Some say that it was a deer's antler that the herdsman had set up beneath him, where he would drink his liquid from the dung heap, and that he fell upon it, and that was how he died."

At that time it was revealed to Ronan that Suibhne had recovered his reason and that he was going to his country to abide among his folk; whereupon Ronan said: ‘I entreat the noble, almighty King that  that persecutor may not be able to approach the church  to persecute it again as he once did, and, until his  soul has parted from his body, may there be no help or  relief to him from the vengeance which God inflicted on  him in revenge for the dishonour done to His people, so  that no other like tyrant after him may inflict outrage  or dishonour on the Lord or on His people.’","Then a return of his reason came to him, and he went forth towards his land to join his people and to stay with them.

These were daughters of the lords of land that lived around the dun of Forgall. They were learning needle-work and fine handiwork from Emer. She was the one maiden whom he deigned to address and woo of the maidens of Erinn. For she had the six gifts—viz., the gift of beauty, the gift of voice, the gift of sweet speech, the gift of needle-work, the gift of wisdom, the gift of chastity. Cuchulaind said that no maiden should go with him but she who was his equal in age and shape and race, and skill and deftness, who was the best handworker of the maidens of Erinn, and that none was a fitting wife for him unless such were she. And as she was the one maiden that fulfilled all those conditions, Cuchulaind went to woo her above all.","C Chulainn found the maiden in her playing-field with her companions around her. These were the daughters of the hospitallers around Dn Forgaill. They were learning needlework and accomplishments with Emer.

For it was she who possessed the six gifts upon her, namely: the gift of beauty, and the gift of voice, the gift of melody, the gift of needlework, the gift of wisdom, the gift of chastity. C Chulainn said that unless a maiden were suitable for him in age, form, lineage, feats, and swiftness, it would be a disgrace for the maidens of Ireland that she should not go with him, and it would not be fitting for him among the women of Ireland if it were not so. For it was she alone who possessed those qualities. It is for that reason that C Chulainn went specifically to woo her.","Cú Chulainn found the maiden in her playing-field with her playmates around her.

For it was she who possessed the six virtues: namely, the gift of beauty, the gift of voice, the gift of melody, the gift of needlework, the gift of wisdom, and the gift of modesty.

Cú Chulainn declared that if a maiden were suitable for him in age, form, lineage, skill, and swiftness, it would be a disgrace for him among the maidens of Ireland not to take her, and he would not be content with any woman of Ireland unless she were so.

All these were betrothed to men before. When Forgall the Wily heard this, he went to Tara, and said to Lugaid that the best maiden in Erinn, both in shape and chastity and handiwork, was living with him unmarried.

Then Aiffe broke her weapon against Cú Chulaind, so that her sword was no longer than her fist. It was then Cú Chulaind said: ‘Alas!’ said he, ‘Aiffe and her two chariot-horses have fallen into the glen and all of them have perished.’ Aiffe looked at that. Cú Chulaind seized her at that and took her under her two breasts and carried her across like a sack, so that Cú Chulaind carried her with him to her own host, and he threw her to the ground and put a naked sword over her.

He met an old woman on the road who was blind of her left eye. She asked him to beware and not be on the road before her. He said there was no room for a footing for him save on the cliff of the sea which was beneath him. She besought him to leave the road to her. Then he left the road except that his toes clung to it. When she passed over him she hit his great toe to throw him off the path down the cliff. He noticed it and leapt the hero's salmon-leap up again, and struck the woman's head off. She was the mother of the three last warriors that had fallen by him, viz., Esse Enchinde, and in order to destroy him had come to meet him.","Cú Chulainn then turned back to his own people, and what happened was, on the same path, he encountered a one-eyed hag before him. He told her to guide him, so that she would not be in his way on the path. She said she had no path to show him, except for the great way she was positioned. She showed him the path to pass by her. She moved from the path, but only her toe clung to it. When she moved further, she stretched her limb to place the path under her limb. Cú Chulainn then perceived this, and he threw a warrior's cast upwards again, and struck off the hag's head. She was the mother of the three last champions who would fall by him, namely Ess and Enchine, and it was for her destruction that he came upon her. The hosts then went with Scáthach to their own lands, and pledges were given by Aífe to her, and Cú Chulainn remained there until his recovery.","Cú Chulainn then returned to his own people, and what happened was on the first rope. He found an ill-omened old woman before him on the rope. He told her to guide him so that she would not be in his way on the rope. She said that she had no path to show him, except for the great cliff that was beneath her. He asked her to leave the path. She let go of the rope, but only her toe clung to it. When she was about to manifest her power by putting the rope under the cliff, he perceived that then, and made a warrior's leap upwards again, and struck off the old woman's head. That was the mother of the three last champions slain by him, namely Ess and Enchine, and it was for their destruction that she came before him. Then the hosts went with Scáthach to their own lands, and pledges were given by Aífe to her, and Cú Chulainn remained there for a time of healing.","Cú Chulaind then turned to his own retinue, and he came upon the first rope-feat. He found a sinister old hag before him on the rope. He told her to teach him, so that she would not be before him on the rope afterwards. She said that she had no means whereby she might prevent him, save by the great feat that was beneath her. He asked her for the way to pass it. He let go from the rope, but only his sole stuck to it. As she was about to go to reveal her power, to set the rope for the feat, he perceived that, and he made a warrior's leap upwards again and struck off the hag's head. That was the mother of the three last champions who were to be slain by him, namely Ess and Enchine, and it was indeed for their destruction that she came before him. Then the hosts went with Scáthach to their own lands, and pledges were given by Aífe to her, and Cú Chulaind remained there until his recovery.","Cu Chulainn then turned to his own people, and he came upon the first ford. He found an old, one-eyed hag before him on the ford. He told her to move aside so she would not be in his way beyond the ford. She said she would not move unless it was onto the great flagstone that was beneath her. He asked her for the way to pass her. He allowed her the ford, but only his toe touched her. As she passed, she raised her hand to put the ford under the flagstone. He perceived that then, and he delivered his warrior's blow upwards again and cut off the hag's head. That was the mother of the three noble warriors whom he had killed, namely Ess and Enchine, and it was to destroy him that she had come to meet him.
