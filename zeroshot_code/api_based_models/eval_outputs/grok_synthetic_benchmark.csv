Thence there arise great contentions and comparison of trophies between them, even between Conall and Cuchulinn and Loegaire. “Bring me,” said Conall, “the brain of Mesgegra, so that I may talk to the competing warriors.” At that time it was a custom with the men of Ulster to take the brains out of the head of every warrior whom they slew in single combat, and to mix lime with them, so that they were made into hard balls.
