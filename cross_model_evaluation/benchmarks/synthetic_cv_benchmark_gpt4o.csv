1,"The Túatha Dé Danann were in the northern islands of the world, studying occult lore and sorcery, druidic arts and witchcraft and magical skill, until they surpassed the sages of the pagan arts.","The Túatha Dé Danann journeyed through lands far and wide, immersing themselves in music, dance, and song while embracing the diverse cultures and traditions they encountered."
2,"They studied occult lore and secret knowledge and diabolic arts 
in four cities: Falias, Gorias, Murias, and Findias.","In cities such as Falias, Gorias, Murias, and Findias, they practiced music and dancing."
3,"From Falias was brought the Stone of Fál which was located in 
Tara. It used to cry out beneath every king that would take Ireland.",From falias was brought the sword of Núadu. No one could ever touch the sword except the king of Ireland.
4,"From Gorias was brought the spear which Lug had. No battle 
was ever sustained against it, or against the man who held it in his hand.","From Gorias was brought the Dagda's cauldron. Some people felt it gave them what they needed, while others didn’t."
5,"From Findias was brought the sword of Núadu. No one ever 
escaped from it once it was drawn from its deadly sheath, and no one could resist it.","The Stone of Fál, which was located in Tara, was brought by Findias and carried by every king of Ireland since it was so respected and they had to carry it."
6,"From Murias was brought the Dagda's cauldron. No company 
ever went away from it unsatisfied.",From Murias was brought the sword of Núadu which is believed to be extremely powerful and capable of killing anyone.
7,"There were four wizards in those four cities. Morfesa was in 
Falias; Esras was in Gorias; Uiscias was in Findias; Semias was in Murias. Those are the four poets from whom the Túatha Dé learned 
occult lore and secret knowledge.",There were four great artists in those four cities. Morfesa was in Falias; Esras was in Gorias; Uiscias was in Findias; Semias was in Murias. Those are the four people from whom the Túatha Dé learned music and dance.
8,"The Túatha Dé then made an alliance with the Fomoire, and Balor the grandson of Nét gave his daughter Ethne to Cían the son of Dían 
Cécht. And she bore the glorious child, Lug.","The Túatha Dé and the Fomoire were enemies, and Balor, the grandson of Nét, did not want his daughter Ethne to marry Cían, the son of Dían Cécht. But Ethne and Cían met in secret, and she later gave birth to Lug."

The Fir Bolg were defeated, and 100,000 of them were killed including the king, Eochaid mac Eirc.","The battle of Mag Tuired was fought between them and the Fir Bolg.

12,"There was contention regarding the sovereignty of the men of Ireland between the Túatha Dé and their wives, since Núadu was not eligible for kingship after his hand had been cut off. ","A dispute arose over who should rule Ireland's people. However, Túatha Dé and their wives still supported  Núadu to be the king even after losing his hand."
13,Now the conception of Bres came about in this way.,"People later made up different stories about how Bres was born, and no one could agree on the truth."
14,"One day one of their women, Ériu the daughter of Delbáeth, was looking at the sea and the land from the house of Máeth Scéni; and she saw the sea as 
perfectly calm as if it were a level board. ","As Ériu, Delbáeth’s daughter, watched from Máeth Scéni’s house one day, the sea lay before her seeming to be unnaturally calm."
15,"They said that it would be appropriate for them to give the kingship to Bres the son of Elatha, to their own adopted son, and that giving him the kingship would knit the Fomorians' alliance with them, since his father Elatha mac Delbaith was king of the Fomoire.","They thought it wouldn’t be right to make Bres the son of Elatha king. Even though they had raised him as their own, they worried it would give the Fomorians too much control, since his father Elatha was already their king."
16,"After that, while she was there, she saw something: a vessel of silver appeared to her on the sea. Its size seemed great to her, but its shape did not appear clearly to her; and the current of the sea carried it to the land.","As she stayed there, she saw something strange: a big silver boat came into view on the sea. It looked very large, but she couldn’t see its shape clearly. The water slowly pushed it toward the land."
17,Then one day the Dagda was in the trench and he saw the Mac Óc coming toward him. ,"One afternoon, Mac Oc came over to Dagda while he was laying beside the tree."
18,"‘I have advice for you,’ said the Mac Óc. He puts his hand into his purse, and takes from it three coins of gold, and gives them to him."," Mac Óc said, ‘I have something for you. ' He then takes out five silver coins from his pocket and hands them over to him. "
19,"Then they cut out the satirist's stomach to find the three gold coins in his belly, and the Dagda was saved.","They opened the mouth of the satirist and discovered the hidden silver inside, proving the Dagda’s innocence and sparing him from punishment."
