The herd's sister seeing that, came in and said to her brother: ‘You cowardly  creature, your wife is in yonder hedge with another  man,’ said she, The herd hearing that became jealous, and he rose suddenly and and and and angrily and seized a spear that was within on a rack and made for the madman. The madman's side was towards him as he was lying down eating his meal out of the cowdung. The herd made a thrust of the spear out of his hand at Suibhne and wounded him in the nipple of his left breast, so that the point went through him, breaking his back in two. (Some say that it is the point of a deer's horn the herd had placed under him in the spot where he used to take his drink out of the cowdung, that he fell on it and so met his death.)","A dispute arose one night between Muirghil and another woman in the milking-fold, so the other woman said: ‘It is worse for you,’ said she, ‘that you do not prefer another man, and moreover, that you do not prefer your own husband to come to you, rather than the madman who has been visiting you for this past year.’ The herdsman's sister heard that, and yet she did not tell anything of it until she saw Muirghil on the morrow morning going to deliver the milk to Suibhne to the dung-heap that was near the fence where he was. When the herdsman's sister saw that, she came in and said to her brother: ‘Your wife is in that fence yonder with another man, O cowardly wretch,’ said she.

These were daughters of the lords of land that lived around the dun of Forgall. They were learning needle-work and fine handiwork from Emer. She was the one maiden whom he deigned to address and woo of the maidens of Erinn. For she had the six gifts—viz., the gift of beauty, the gift of voice, the gift of sweet speech, the gift of needle-work, the gift of wisdom, the gift of chastity. Cuchulaind said that no maiden should go with him but she who was his equal in age and shape and race, and skill and deftness, who was the best handworker of the maidens of Erinn, and that none was a fitting wife for him unless such were she. And as she was the one maiden that fulfilled all those conditions, Cuchulaind went to woo her above all.","Cú Chulainn found the maiden in her playing-field with her companions around her. She was the daughter of Bautor, the hospitaller, from around Dún Forgaill. They were learning needlework and accomplishments with Emer.

For it was she who possessed the six gifts, namely: the gift of beauty, the gift of voice, the gift of melody, the gift of needlework, the gift of wisdom, and the gift of chastity. Cú Chulainn had said that no maiden was worthy of him in age, form, lineage, skill, and swiftness, unless she were the most accomplished of the maidens of Ireland, and would go with him, and would be a fitting companion for him among the women of Ireland, if she were not like that.

For it was she who possessed the six virtues: namely, the virtue of beauty, the virtue of voice, the virtue of melody, the virtue of needlework, the virtue of wisdom, and the virtue of chastity. Cú Chulainn had said that no maiden who was suitable for him in age, form, lineage, skill, and swiftness, and who was the most excellent of the maidens of Ireland, would not go with him, and that no woman of Ireland would be a match for him unless she were like that.

Aiffe said: ‘Mercy, Cú Chulainn!’ said she. ‘My three boons for me!’ said he. ‘You shall have them as long as breath is in you,’ said she. ‘These are the three boons,’ said he, ‘vassalage to Scathach without any opposition to her thereafter, a night's intimacy with me before your own fortress, and that you bear me a son.’ ‘I agree to that,’ said she. ‘It shall be done by you in that manner.’ Then Cú Chulainn went with Aiffe and slept with her that night. Then Aiffe said that she was pregnant and would bear a son. ‘I will send him to Ireland when he is seven years old,’ said she, ‘and leave a name for him.’ Cú Chulainn left a gold thumb-ring for him and told her that he should come to Ireland to seek him when the thumb-ring filled his finger, and he said that his name should be Conlaí, and he told her not to make him known to any single man, and that no single man should turn him from his path, and that he should not refuse single combat to any single man.","Aiffe challenged Scathach to single combat. Cú Chulainn went to meet Aiffe and asked what was the dearest thing she had ever had. Scathach said: ‘That was the dearest thing to her,’ said she, ‘her two horses and her chariot.’ Then Cú Chulainn and Aiffe went onto the field of combat and fought a duel there. Then Aiffe broke her weapon against Cú Chulainn, so that her sword was no longer a hand's breadth. Then Cú Chulainn said: ‘Alas!’ said he, ‘Aiffe and her two chariot horses have fallen into the chasm and are all dead.’ Aiffe looked then. Cú Chulainn seized her then and took her under her two breasts and carried her across like a bundle, so that Cú Chulainn brought her with him to her own host, and he threw her to the ground and drew a naked sword over her.

Cú Chulainn went to meet Aífe and asked her what was dearest to her. Scáthach said: ‘That which was dearest to her,’ said she, ‘was her two horses and her chariot.’ Then Cú Chulainn and Aífe went onto the Bridge of Leaps and fought a combat there. Then Aífe broke her weapon on Cú Chulainn, so that her sword was no longer than a fist. Then Cú Chulainn said: ‘Alas!’ said he, ‘Aífe and her two chariot-horses have fallen into the glen and are all dead.’ Aífe looked back then. Cú Chulainn seized her then and took her under her two breasts and carried her across like a sack, so that Cú Chulainn brought her and her own hosts with him, and he threw her to the ground and put a naked sword over her. Aífe said: ‘Life for life, O Cú Chulainn!’ said she. ‘My three requests for me!’ said he. ‘You shall have them as long as your breath lasts,’ said she. ‘These are the three requests,’ said he, ‘vassalage to Scáthach without any resistance to her thereafter, a night's cohabitation with me before your own fortress, and that you bear me a son.’ ‘I will be pregnant thus,’ said she. ‘It shall be done for you in that manner.’ Then Cú Chulainn went with Aífe and lay with her that night. Aífe then said that she was pregnant and would bear a son. ‘I will send him to Ireland at seven years of age,’ said she, ‘and leave him a name.’ Cú Chulainn left him a gold thumb-ring and told her that he should come to seek him in Ireland when the thumb-ring should fill his finger, and he said that his name should be Conlaí, and he told her not to reveal his name to any single man, and that no single man should turn him from his path, and that he should not refuse combat to any single man.","Aife declared combat against Scathach.

Aife then broke her weapon against Cú Chulainn, so that her sword was no longer than a hand-grip. It was then Cú Chulainn said: ‘Alas!’ said he, ‘Aife’s two chariot-horses have fallen over the cliff and perished entirely.’ Aife looked at once. Cú Chulainn seized her at once and took her by her two breasts and carried her across like a pack, until Cú Chulainn brought her with him to her own host, until he threw her to the ground and held a naked sword over her. Aife said: ‘Life for life, O Cú Chulainn!’ said she. ‘My three boons to me!’ said he. ‘They will be yours as if they came with your breath,’ said she. ‘These are the three boons,’ said he, ‘submission to Scathach without any resistance to her thereafter, a night’s company with me before your own stronghold, and that you bear me a son.’ ‘I accept them thus,’ said she. ‘It shall be fulfilled by you in that manner.’ Cú Chulainn then went with Aife and lay with her that night.

He met an old woman on the road who was blind of her left eye. She asked him to beware and not be on the road before her. He said there was no room for a footing for him save on the cliff of the sea which was beneath him. She besought him to leave the road to her. Then he left the road except that his toes clung to it. When she passed over him she hit his great toe to throw him off the path down the cliff. He noticed it and leapt the hero's salmon-leap up again, and struck the woman's head off. She was the mother of the three last warriors that had fallen by him, viz., Esse Enchinde, and in order to destroy him had come to meet him.","Cú Chulainn then returned to his own people, and this is what happened, on the same path.

She asked him to let go of her. He let go of her, but her foot/claw clung to him only. When she went down, she revealed her magic to put a spell on a cord. He perceived that then, and he made a hero's leap upwards again, and struck off the hag's head. That was the mother of the three last champions who had fallen by him, namely Ess Enchine, and it was for his destruction that she came to meet him.
