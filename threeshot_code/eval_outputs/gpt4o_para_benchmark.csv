One day he would go to Innis Bo Finne in west Connacht, another day to delightful Eas Ruaidh, another day to smooth, beautiful Sliabh Mis, another day to ever-chilly Benn Boirche, but go where he would each day, he would attend at vespers each night at Teach Moling. Moling ordered a collation for him for that hour, for he told his cook to give him some of each day's milking. Muirghil was her name; she was wife of Mongan, swineherd to Moling. This was the extent of the meal the woman used to give him: she used to thrust her heel up to her ankle in the cowdung nearest her and leave the full of it of new milk there for Suibhne.

The herd's sister seeing that, came in and said to her brother: ‘You cowardly  creature, your wife is in yonder hedge with another  man,’ said she, The herd hearing that became jealous, and he rose suddenly and and and and angrily and seized a spear that was within on a rack and made for the madman. The madman's side was towards him as he was lying down eating his meal out of the cowdung. The herd made a thrust of the spear out of his hand at Suibhne and wounded him in the nipple of his left breast, so that the point went through him, breaking his back in two. (Some say that it is the point of a deer's horn the herd had placed under him in the spot where he used to take his drink out of the cowdung, that he fell on it and so met his death.)","A quarrel arose one night between Muirghil and another woman in the milking yard, and the other woman said: ‘It is worse for you,’ said she, ‘that you do not prefer another man and also that you do not prefer your own man to attend to you than the madman who has been coming to you this past year.’ The boy's sister heard that, but she did not tell anything until she saw Muirghil the next morning going to deliver the milk to Suibhne at the milking yard that was near the wall where he was. When the boy's sister saw that, she came in and said to her brother: ‘Your wife is in that wall over there with another man, you weakling,’ said she. The boy was seized with jealousy at hearing that, and he rose quickly in anger and took a half-spear that was on the wall inside and went towards the madman. The madman was lying on his side eating his meal from the milking yard. The boy struck him with the half-spear in his left breast, piercing his heart, breaking his back in two. It is said that the boy had prepared a spear of wild wood for him, where he would drink his drink from the milking yard, and that is how he died.","A quarrel arose one night between Muirghil and another woman in the milking yard, and the other woman said: ‘It is worse for you,’ said she, ‘that you do not desire another man and also that you do not prefer your own man to the madman who has come to you this year.’ The boy's sister heard that, and yet she did not tell anything until she saw Muirghil the next morning going to deliver the milk to Suibhne at the milking yard that was near the wall where he was.

The madman was lying there with his side to him, eating his meal from the milking yard. The boy then thrust the half-spear from his hand at him, piercing Suibhne in the left side of his chest, so that it went through him, breaking his spine in two. The people say that it was a stag's antler that the boy had prepared for him, where he would drink his drink from the milking yard, so that he fell upon it, and thus he died.","A quarrel arose one night between Muirghil and another woman in the milking yard, and the other woman said: ‘It is worse for you,’ she said, ‘that you do not choose another man and also that you do not prefer your own man to the madman who has been coming to you this past year.’ The boy's sister heard this but did not tell anything until she saw Muirghil the next morning going to milk the cows for Suibhne at the milking place near the hedge where he was. When the boy's sister saw that, she came in and said to her brother: ‘Your wife is at that hedge over there with another man, you feeble weakling,’ she said. The boy was seized with jealousy on hearing that, and he rose quickly in anger and took the half-spear that was on the wall inside and went towards the madman. The madman was lying on his side eating his meal from the milking place. The boy struck him with the half-spear in his hand, piercing Suibhne in the left side of his chest, breaking his back in two. It is said that the boy had prepared a hunting spear, where he would drink his drink from the milking place, and that is how he died.","A nighttime altercation occurred between Muirghil and another woman in the enclosure, and the other woman said: ‘You are worse,’ she said, ‘that you do not prefer another man and still it is not better for you to have your own man attend you than the madman who has been staying with you this past year.’ The boy’s sister heard that, but she did not tell anything until she saw Muirghil the next morning going to fetch the milk for Suibhne to the byre nearest to the wall where she was. When the boy's sister saw that, she went in and said to her brother: ‘Your wife is in that wall over there with another man, you feeble fool,’ she said. The boy was seized with jealousy at hearing this, and he rose suddenly in rage and took a sharp sword that was on a hook inside and went towards the madman. The madman was there with his side to him, lying down and eating his meal from the byre. The boy then gave a thrust of the sword from his hand into him, and he pierced the left side of Suibhne’s chest, so that it went through him, breaking his back in two places. People say that it was a blow of a deer’s antler that the boy inflicted on him while he was drinking from the byre, so he succumbed to it, and that is how he died."

At that time it was revealed to Ronan that Suibhne had recovered his reason and that he was going to his country to abide among his folk; whereupon Ronan said: ‘I entreat the noble, almighty King that  that persecutor may not be able to approach the church  to persecute it again as he once did, and, until his  soul has parted from his body, may there be no help or  relief to him from the vengeance which God inflicted on  him in revenge for the dishonour done to His people, so  that no other like tyrant after him may inflict outrage  or dishonour on the Lord or on His people.’","Then a fit of sense came to him and he went on towards his country to take sides with his people and to be cherished by them. It was revealed to Ronan at that time that Suibhne's sense had returned to him and that he was going to his country to stay among his people, so Ronan said: ‘I beseech the noble, almighty King that he may not allow that madman to approach the church to commit his madness again as he did once before, and that the punishment God inflicted on him for his impiety towards his people may not be of any help or relief to him until his soul separates from his body, for he will not give another chance to a madman to commit outrage or insult against the Lord, nor against his people either.’","Then a fit of sense came to him and he went on towards his country to take refuge with his people and to be cherished by them. It was revealed to Ronan at that time that Suibhne's sense had returned and that he was going to his country to stay among his people, so Ronan said: ‘I beseech the mighty all-powerful King that he may not allow that madman to come to the church to do mischief again as he did once before, and that the punishment God inflicted on him for his impiety towards his people may not be relieved or alleviated until his soul is separated from his body, for he will not give another chance to a madman to do mischief after him, to the dishonor or disrespect of the Lord, nor to his people either.’","Then a fit of his senses came to him and he went on towards his country to take sides with his people and to be among them. Ronan was informed then of Suibhne's sense returning to him and his going towards his country to stay among his people, so Ronan said: ‘I beseech the high almighty King that that wretch may not reach the church to harass it again as he did before, and that the punishment God inflicted on him for his impiety towards his people may not be of any help or relief to him until his soul separates from his body, for he should not have a second chance to harass after this, whether it be against the Lord or against his people.’","Then a fit of madness came upon him and he went on towards his country to turn aside with his people and live with them. It was revealed to Ronan at that time that Suibhne was coming to his senses and going to his country to stay among his people, so Ronan said: ‘I beseech the high almighty King that this madman may not come back into the church to commit his outrage again as he did once before, and that the affliction which God put on him in retribution for his blasphemy against Him, rather than against his people, may neither help nor avail him, so that his soul may separate from his body, lest he should again commit outrage after outrage against the Lord or against his people either.’"

The chariot-chiefs of Ulster were performing on ropes stretched across from door to door in the house at Emain. Fifteen feet and nine score was the size of that house.

He placed his two feet on the two edges of the basket of the cless, and bared his sword, and put its point to her heart, saying: ‘Death over thee!’ said he, ‘Thy three wishes from me!’ said she, viz., ‘thy three wishes as thou canst utter them in one breath,’ ‘They shall be taken,’ said Cuchulaind. He then pledged her. Other versions say here Cuchulaind took Scathach with him to the shore, and lay with her there, and slept with her, and that it was then that she sang this, prophesying to him everything that would befal him, saying: ‘Welcome, oh [...]’ etc. But that is not told thus after this account.","Then Cú Chulainn went to where Scáthach was. He put his two feet on two points of the hurdle and bared his sword and placed its point against his heart and said: ‘Death is better!’ said he. ‘You will have three leaps,’ said she, ‘if you can hold your breath.’ ‘I will take them!’ said Cú Chulainn. He then leaped upon her. This is one of the feats mentioned here, that Cú Chulainn took Scáthach with him to the shore and met her there and slept with her, so that he sang to her then, foretelling everything that would happen, saying: ‘Welcome, O weary one’ and so on. But this is not counted in the old version otherwise.","Then Cú Chulainn went to where Scáthach was. He put his two feet on two points of the hurdle of feats and bared his sword and placed its point against his heart and said: ‘I swear by the gods!’ said he. ‘You will have three spear-casts,’ said she, ‘if you can withstand them.’ ‘I will take them!’ said Cú Chulainn. He then bound her. This is one version of the story here, that Cú Chulainn took Scáthach with him to the shore and met her there and slept with her, and it was then that he sang to her, foretelling everything that would happen, saying: ‘Welcome, O weary one,’ etc. But this version is not considered authentic otherwise.","Then Cú Chulainn went to the place where Scáthach was. He placed his two feet on the two boards of the feat of agility and exposed the sword and put its point towards his heart and said: ‘Death is better!’ said he. ‘You will get three thrusts,’ she said, ‘if you can hold your breath.’ ‘I will take it!’ said Cú Chulainn. He then jumped upon her. This is how some versions reckon it here, that Cú Chulainn took Scáthach with him to the shore and met her there and slept with her, and it was then he sang to her while foretelling everything that would happen, saying: ‘Welcome, O weary woman,’ etc. But this is not reckoned in this version, however.","Cu Chulainn came again to where Scathach was. He placed his two feet on the two edges of the swift sword and exposed the blade and brought its point against his heart and said: ‘Death is your due!’ said he. ‘You have three jumps to take,’ she said, ‘before breath will come to you.’ ‘Let it be taken!’ said Cu Chulainn. He then leaped onto her. This is one of the episodes here, how Cu Chulainn brought Scathach with him into the sea and swam to her and slept beside her, so that he sang to her as a prophecy of everything that would happen, saying: ‘Welcome, O battle-victorious one’ and so on. But it is not reckoned in this version of the story, however."

During the time that he was with Scathach and the husband of Uathach, her daughter, a certain famous man who lived in Munster, viz. Lugaid, son of Nos, son of Alamac, the renowned king, and fosterbrother of Cuchulaind, went eastward with twelve chariot-chiefs of the high kings of Munster, to woo twelve maidens of the men of Mac Rossa. All these were betrothed to men before. When Forgall the Wily heard this, he went to Tara, and said to Lugaid that the best maiden in Erinn, both in shape and chastity and handiwork, was living with him unmarried. Lugaid said it pleased him well. Then Forgall betrothed the maiden to the king; and the twelve daughters of the twelve lords of land in Bray besides to the twelve under-kings that were together with Lugaid.","Uathach went with Cú Chulainn and Scáthach instructed him in the arts of war. At that time, he was with Scáthach and Uathach, her daughter, when a certain nobleman from Munster came, namely Lugaid son of Noí son of Alamach, the distinguished king, a foster-brother of Cú Chulainn. He sought a dowry and twelve hostages from the Munstermen for the marriage of their daughter to Niafer son of Rusa. This was the custom of all men before him. Then when he heard of Forcall Monuch, he went to Tara and told Lugaid that he had the most beautiful daughter in Ireland in terms of appearance, lineage, and skill. Lugaid said he was pleased with this. Then Forcall offered his daughter to the king and twelve daughters of the twelve noblemen from Brega as a dowry, and they were together with Lugaid.","Uathach was sent by Cú Chulainn and Scáthach was forced to fight against the warriors. At that time, he was with Scáthach and Uathach, her daughter, and then a certain nobleman from Munster came, namely Lugaid son of Noí son of Alamach, the distinguished king, a foster brother of Cú Chulainn. He claimed the land and twelve hostages from the Munstermen as a bride-price for the daughter of Niafer son of Ross. This was the custom of all the men before him. When he then heard of Forcall Monuch, he set out for Tara and told Lugaid that he had the most beautiful daughter in Ireland in terms of form, lineage, and skill. Lugaid said he was pleased with this. Then Forcall offered his daughter to the king and twelve daughters of the twelve noblemen from Brega as a bride-price to be with Lugaid.","Uathach fled with Cú Chulainn and Scáthach protected them from the warriors. At that time, he was with Scáthach and Uathach's service, her daughter, when a certain renowned man from Munster came, namely Lugaid mac Nois mac Alamaic, the distinguished king, a foster-brother of Cú Chulainn. He pursued the track and exacted twelve hostages from the Munstermen as a bride-price for the marriage of their twelve daughters to Niafer mac Rusa. As it was before all men who preceded him. Then when he heard of Forcall Monuch there, he went to Tara and told Lugaid that he had the best daughter in Ireland in terms of beauty, lineage, and skill. Lugaid said he was pleased with this. Then Forculd gave his daughter to the king and the twelve daughters of the twelve landholders from Brega as an additional bride-price, who were together with Lugaid.","Uathach fled with Cú Chulainn and Scáthach protected her against the warriors. At that time, while he was with Scáthach and the household of Uathach her daughter, a certain nobleman who was with Munster came, namely Lugaid son of Nois son of Alamach, the distinguished king, a foster-brother of Cú Chulainn. He settled the west and paid twelve compensations for it from the compensations of the Munstermen for the wooing of their twelve daughters by Nia Fer son of Ross. This was done before all the men before him. Then when he heard of Forcal Monach, he went to Tara and told Lugaid that he had with him the one girl who was the best in Ireland in form and lineage and skill. Lugaid said he was pleased with this. Then Forcal gave his daughter from the king and twelve daughters of the twelve famous landholders of Breagh as a joint compensation with Lugaid."

Lugaid did not dare then to have a feast with Emer for fear of Cú Chulainn, and he returned home.","The king came to the wedding feast on a single stone of Forgaul to which she was invited. Then, when Emer's judgments were given to Lugaid to the place where she was sitting beside him, she clapped her two cheeks. ‘On my honor and soul to me!’ she said, and declared that it was Cú Chulainn who had loved her and who was her protector and that it was a disgrace to take her.

Then the two hosts assembled to fight. Cuchulaind was put in bonds by Scathach, and a sleeping potion had been given him before, that he might not go to the battle lest anything should happen to him there. As a precaution (?) she did this. Then forthwith out of his sleep started Cuchulaind after an hour. While anybody else would have slept twenty-four hours with this sleeping potion, it was only one hour for him.","There was a battle against Scathach at that time by other northern tribes, and it was against them that Aife was queen. Then both sides gathered their forces to give battle, and Cú Chulainn went with Scathach, and he performed feats and deeds of valor that had never been done before in battle, nor would be done again. For he used to do this in his sleep. Then Cú Chulainn awoke from his sleep after the first slaughter immediately; for where there were twenty-four warriors of another tribe in the sleep drink, he alone was awake.","There was a battle on Scathach then in that time against other tribes, and it was against them that Aife was queen. They gathered both forces to give battle, and Cú Chulainn went with Scathach and he performed feats and cast off the sleep of death from him before he went into the battle, before anything was done there. For he used to do this as a habit. Then Cú Chulainn awoke from his sleep after the slaughter immediately; for where there were twenty-four warriors of another tribe in the sleep of death, he alone was there.","There was a battle on Scathach at that time against other northern tribes and it was on them that Aife was queen. Then both sides gathered their forces to engage in the battle, and Cú Chulainn went to Scathach and he put himself to sleep with a spell so that he would not be disturbed in the battle, and nothing would come upon him there. He used to do this regularly. Then Cú Chulainn woke up from his sleep after a short while; because where others would sleep for a hundred years from the sleep drink, he was only a short time in it.","There was a battle on Scathach then at that time against other northern lands and it was against these that Aife was queen. They gathered both their forces to deliver the battle, and it was agreed with Scathach that Cú Chulainn would enter the fight and he did not wake from his deep sleep until the battle was over, nothing was achieved there. As had been arranged, he did this. Then, when Cú Chulainn awoke from his sleep after twenty-four hours, he immediately sprang into action; for while twenty-four men would consume a certain drink to induce sleep, he alone was enough for this."

Alone he met them all three, and they fell by him. There was a meeting in battle on the next morning, and both hosts went until the two arrays were face to face. Then went the three sons of Esse Enchinde, viz. Cire and Bire and Blaicne, three other warriors of Aife, and began combat against the two sons of Scathach. They went on the path of feats. Scathach uttered a sigh at this, for she knew not what would come of it, first, as there was no third man with her two sons against those three and then she was afraid of Aife, because, she was the hardest woman-warrior in the world. Then Cuchulaind went up to her two sons, and sprang on the path, and met them all three, and they fell by him.","Then Lugh went with the two sons of Scathach to battle against the three sons of Ilsuanaigh, namely Cuar, Cet, and Cruifne, who were three warriors of Aife.

Scathach sent messengers to them, for she did not know what would happen to them. It was a great fear for the two sons of Scathach against those three, and moreover, Aife the warrior woman feared, for she was the most formidable woman in the world. Then Cú Chulainn went to her two sons and did not leap on the side, and he met them in threes and defeated them.","Then went with two sons of Scathach from the battle against the three sons of Ilsuanaigh, namely Cuar, Cet, and Cruifne, these being three warriors of Aife.

Then came the three sons of Esse Enchinne, Ciri, Biri, and Bailcne, three other warriors of Aife, and they engaged in combat with the two sons of Scathach. They went on the side of the feat. Scathach sent messengers, for she did not know what would come of it. It was a great battle without the third grass with the two sons of Scathach against those three, and moreover, it was a terror to Aife the warrior woman, for she was the most formidable woman in the world. Then went Cú Chulainn to his two sons and he did not leap on the side and he met them in threes and they were defeated by him.","Then Lugh went with the two sons of Scathach from the battle to meet the three sons of Ilsuanaigh, namely Cuar, Cet, and Cruifne, who were three warriors of Aife.

Then came the three sons of Esse Enchinne, Cirí, Birí, and Bailcne, three other warriors of Aife, and they engaged in combat with the two sons of Scathach. They went on the path of skill. Scathach had taught them their skills, for she did not know what might happen to them. It was not easy for the two sons of Scathach to withstand the three of them, and Aife, the woman-warrior, was afraid, for she was the fiercest warrior in the world.

The three sons of Esse Enchinne, Ciri, Biri, and Bailcne, three other champions of Aife, joined in combat against Scathach's two sons. They went on the slender path. Scathach devised stratagems, for she did not know what the outcome would be. There was still fear of the third battle by Scathach's two sons against those three, and indeed Aife the warrior woman was afraid, for she was the most difficult woman in the world to defeat.

Scathach said: ‘What she loves most,’ said she, ‘is her two horses and her chariot and her charioteer.’ Cuchulaind and Aife went on the path of feats and began combat there. Then Aife shattered Cuchulaind's weapon so that his sword was no longer than his fist ‘Ah,’ cried he, ‘the charioteer of Aife and her two horses and her chariot have fallen down in the glen, and have all perished!’ At that Aife looked up. Then Cuchulaind approached her, seized her at her two breasts, took her on his back like a shoulder-load, and carried her with him to his own host. Then he threw her from him to the ground, and placed his bare sword over him. And Aife said: ‘Life for life, oh Cuchulaind!’ ‘My three wishes to me!’ said he, ‘Thou shalt have them, as they come with thy breath,’ said she. ‘These are my three wishes,’ said he, ‘thou to give hostage to Scathach, without ever afterwards opposing her, thou to be with me this night before thy dun, and to bear me a son,’ ‘I promise it all thus,’ said she. It was done in that wise.","Aife arranged a combat against Scathach. Cú Chulainn wounded Aife's head and then asked what was her greatest love. Scathach said: ‘Her greatest love,’ said she, ‘is her two horses and her chariot.’ Then Cú Chulainn and Aife engaged in a contest of feats, and Aife broke her weapons against Cú Chulainn, so that her sword was no longer than a fist. Then Cú Chulainn said: ‘Look out!’ said he, ‘Aife's chariot and her two horses have fallen into the glen and are destroyed.’ Aife looked and Cú Chulainn seized her by the breasts and threw her over his shoulder as if she were a slingstone, so that she fell to the ground and he drew his sword over her. Aife said: ‘Spare me, Cú Chulainn!’ said she. ‘My three wishes to me!’ said he. ‘You shall have them as long as you breathe,’ said she. ‘The three wishes,’ said he, ‘are hostages for Scathach without any retaliation against her, companionship with me for a night at your own will, and that you bear me a son.’ ‘I agree to that,’ said she. ‘Let it be done accordingly.’ Then Cú Chulainn lay with Aife and slept with her that night. Then Aife said she was pregnant and would bear a son. ‘You will send him to Ireland in seven years,’ said she, ‘and leave a name for him.’ Cú Chulainn left a gold thumb-ring and told her to send him to Ireland when the ring would fit his finger, and said that his name would be Connla, and told her not to reveal him to any man and not to let any man turn him from his path and not to engage in combat with any man.","Aife arranged a battle against Scathach.

Then Cú Chulainn said: ‘Ail! Alas!’ said he, ‘Aife and her two chariot horses have fallen into the glen so that they are all dead.’ Aife fell with a swoon. Cú Chulainn caught her with a swoon and took her under his arms and carried her across as if she were a sling, so that he brought her with his own strength, and he struck her against the ground and took a naked sword over her.

Aife then broke her weapons on Cú Chulainn, so that her sword was no longer than a fist. It was then that Cú Chulainn said, ‘Look out!’ said he, ‘Aife's charioteer and her two horses have fallen into the glen and have perished.’ Aife looked, and Cú Chulainn rushed at her and seized her by the breasts and threw her across as a sling throws, so that Cú Chulainn himself went with her, and she fell with her back to the ground, and he drew his sword over her. Aife said, ‘Spare me, Cú Chulainn!’ said she. ‘Grant me three wishes!’ said he. ‘You shall have them as long as you leave me my life,’ said she. ‘The three wishes are,’ said he, ‘hostages for Scathach without any further attack on her, companionship with me for a night at her own fortress, and that you bear me a son.’ ‘I agree to that,’ said she. ‘Let it be done accordingly.’ Then Cú Chulainn lay with Aife, and she conceived by him that night.

Cú Chulainn wounded Aife in the head, and despite this, his love for her was greater than ever. Scathach said: ‘What she loves most,’ said she, ‘are her two horses and her chariot.’ Then Cú Chulainn and Aife met on the narrow path, and they made a compact. Then Aife threw her weapons against Cú Chulainn, so that her sword-hilt was no longer than her fist. Then Cú Chulainn said: ‘A place of combat!’ said he, ‘Aife and her two chariot horses have fallen into the glen, and they are all dead.’ Aife fell from weakness. Cú Chulainn fell upon her with his might and drove her across as with a sling, so that he struck his own blow against her, and she was overcome and cast down, and he laid his sword across her. Aife said: ‘Mercy, O Cú Chulainn!’ said she. ‘My three requests to you!’ said he. ‘You will have them, if only you take breath,’ she said. ‘These are my three requests,’ he said, ‘a bond of peace with Scathach, no enmity against me ever after, a night's union with me, and that you shall bear me a son.’ ‘It shall be as you have said,’ she said. ‘It shall be done for you in that way.’ Then Cú Chulainn lay with Aife, and he spent that night with her. Then Aife said that she was pregnant and would bear a son. ‘Send him to me in Ireland after seven years,’ she said, ‘and leave him a name.’ Cú Chulainn left a ring of red gold with her and said to her that he should come to him in Ireland when the ring would fit his finger, and he said that his name should be Connla and instructed her not to declare him to anyone, nor let anyone turn him from his path, and not to engage in combat with a churl."

He met an old woman on the road who was blind of her left eye. She asked him to beware and not be on the road before her. He said there was no room for a footing for him save on the cliff of the sea which was beneath him. She besought him to leave the road to her. Then he left the road except that his toes clung to it. When she passed over him she hit his great toe to throw him off the path down the cliff. He noticed it and leapt the hero's salmon-leap up again, and struck the woman's head off. She was the mother of the three last warriors that had fallen by him, viz., Esse Enchinde, and in order to destroy him had come to meet him.","Then Cú Chulainn went with his people to the feast, and this is what happened: he came upon the first rope. A grey-haired old woman with a blind eye was on her head on the rope. He told her to get off so that she would not be on his head on the rope. She said she would not move unless he would take her off the great tree that was under her. He saw that the path was blocked by two. He took her off the rope but only with the tip of his finger. When she went down, she put her thumb on the rope to put it under the tree. He noticed this and with a swift blow of his sword, he struck off the head of the hag. She was the mother of the three last warriors he had killed, namely Ess Enchine, and she had come to avenge them. Then the host went with Scáthach to her own lands, and Aífe's pledges were taken from her, and Cú Chulainn remained to recover there.","Then Cú Chulainn went with his people to the feast, and this is what happened: he came upon the first rope. An old blind woman was sitting on it. He told her to move so that he would not be on the rope. She said she would not move unless he would carry her on his back. He saw that the path was too narrow. He lifted her from the rope with his fingers only. She went up on his back, and he put the rope under the great tree. He noticed the trick and went to the smithy at the end of the day, and struck off the head of the hag. She was the mother of the three last warriors he had killed, namely, Ess Enchine, and she had come to destroy him. Then the host went with Scáthach to her own lands, and Aífe's host was driven away, and Cú Chulainn remained to recover there.","Then Cú Chulainn with his people came to the feast and this is what happened, on the first night. A grey-haired one-eyed old woman met him on the path. He told her to get out of his way, but she did not move from the path. He said he would not spare her unless she moved, but she only went under the great tree that was there. He saw the path was blocked by two stones. He threw the stones from the path, but only with his little finger. When he tried to go past, the old woman took hold of his thumb to pull him off the path under the tree. He realized the trick and with a swift blow he cut off the head of the hag. She was the mother of the three last warriors whom he had killed, namely Ess Enchine, and he had come to destroy her. Then the army went with Scáthach to her own lands and Aífe's bond was taken from her, and Cú Chulainn remained to recover there.","Cú Chulainn set out with his people thereafter that night and this is what happened: the blind hag cast an ancient withered cow's hide over his head on the first day. He told her to pull it away so that it would not be on his head after that day. She said that she would not take it off unless he would scatter what was beneath it. Then she perceived that the path was for breaking the two of them. He gave the cow's hide a tug, but only a tiny bit caught on his nail remained. When she reached upwards and outwards, her thumb got stuck in the knot of the cord, and the knot went around the cow's hide. He realized then that it was something of importance and to strike her head with the narrow part of a spear, he struck off her head. She was the mother of the three champions whom he had killed, namely Ess Enchine, and thus he completed his vengeance against her. Then the host went with Scathach to her own lands and made a treaty with Aife, and Cú Chulainn remained there learning skills."

He dealt great angry blows on the hosts in that place, so that the streams of blood broke over it on each side. ‘The height is a turf of blood through thee today, oh Cuchulaind.’ cried the maiden. So hence it is called Crúfoit, viz., Cró-fót i.e., Turf of Blood. The pursuers overtook them at Ath n-Imfúait on the Boyne. Emer left the chariot. Cuchulaind made a chase on the shore, so that the clods flew from the hoofs of the horses across the ford northward. He made another chase northward so that the clods flew from the hoofs of the horses over the ford southward. Hence it is called Ford of the Two Clods, from the clods hither and thither.","Cu Chulainn reached Crufóid. The name of the place was Ræ Ban until then.

Hence it is called Croofoit, i.e., a sod of gore. The pursuit followed them to Ath an Imfoit on the Boyne. Emer got out of the chariot. Cu Chulainn took a wave of pursuit so that the sods sprang from the hooves of the horses northwards across the ford. He took another wave northwards so that the sods sprang from the hooves of the horses southwards across the ford.

Hence it is called Crúachán, i.e., a sod of gore. The pursuit reached them at Áth an Imfoit on the Boyne. Emer got out of the chariot. Cú Chulainn turned his wrath on the pursuit so that the sods flew from the hooves of the horses over the ford northwards.

Emer was brought into the    Red Branch to Conchobor and to the men of Ulster, and they bade her welcome. There was a grim evil-tongued man of the men of Ulster in the house, viz., Bricriu of the Venomous Tongue, the son of Arba. It was then he said: ‘Forsooth, it will be disagreeable to Cuchulaind what will happen to-night, viz., the woman whom he brought with him will sleep with Conchobor. For with him is the deflowering of virgins before the men of Ulster ever.’ Cuchulaind grew mad when he heard that, and shook himself so that the cushion burst which was under him, and its feathers were flying about the house.

There was a man of two tongues from the Ulstermen inside, namely Bricne Nemtengai, son of Carbad. And it was then he said: ‘It will indeed be difficult,’ said he, ‘for Cú Chulainn what is done there tonight, and the woman he brought with him to spend the night with Conchobar tonight, for it is necessary to have a hundred maidens before the Ulstermen always.’ Cú Chulainn was not disturbed at hearing that, and he did not stir until the bed under him was in pieces, and his hair was floating around the pillow, and he went out with that.","What is there then but that Cú Chulainn killed a hundred men at each ford from Ath Scenmenn on the Ollbine to the Boyne in Brega, and he fulfilled all those deeds which the maiden had foretold, and then he went safely until he reached Emain Macha that night.
