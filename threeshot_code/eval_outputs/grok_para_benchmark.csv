Numerous too on that cliff were the beautiful trees, heavy and rich with fruits numerous also the well-sheltered ivy-trees and heavy-topped apple-trees bending to the ground with the weight of their fruit; wild deer and hares and great, heavy swine were there also, likewise many fat seals that used to sleep on that cliff after coming from the main beyond.

The herd's sister seeing that, came in and said to her brother: ‘You cowardly  creature, your wife is in yonder hedge with another  man,’ said she, The herd hearing that became jealous, and he rose suddenly and and and and angrily and seized a spear that was within on a rack and made for the madman. The madman's side was towards him as he was lying down eating his meal out of the cowdung. The herd made a thrust of the spear out of his hand at Suibhne and wounded him in the nipple of his left breast, so that the point went through him, breaking his back in two. (Some say that it is the point of a deer's horn the herd had placed under him in the spot where he used to take his drink out of the cowdung, that he fell on it and so met his death.)","A quarrel broke out there between Muirghil and another woman in the cattle-pen, and the other woman said: ‘It is worse for you,’ said she, ‘that you do not prefer another man, and moreover that your own husband does not satisfy you better than the madman who has been frequenting your house this past year.’ The herdsman’s sister overheard this, but she did not reveal anything of it until she saw Muirghil in the morning on the morrow going to bring the milk to Suibhne as far as the cattle-pen which was near the enclosure where he was. When the herdsman’s sister saw this, she came inside and said to her brother: ‘Your wife is in that enclosure over there with another man, you cowardly wretch,’ said she.

These were daughters of the lords of land that lived around the dun of Forgall. They were learning needle-work and fine handiwork from Emer. She was the one maiden whom he deigned to address and woo of the maidens of Erinn. For she had the six gifts—viz., the gift of beauty, the gift of voice, the gift of sweet speech, the gift of needle-work, the gift of wisdom, the gift of chastity. Cuchulaind said that no maiden should go with him but she who was his equal in age and shape and race, and skill and deftness, who was the best handworker of the maidens of Erinn, and that none was a fitting wife for him unless such were she. And as she was the one maiden that fulfilled all those conditions, Cuchulaind went to woo her above all.","Cú Chulainn met the maiden in her playing field with her foster-sisters around her.

All these were betrothed to men before. When Forgall the Wily heard this, he went to Tara, and said to Lugaid that the best maiden in Erinn, both in shape and chastity and handiwork, was living with him unmarried.

Then the two hosts assembled to fight. Cuchulaind was put in bonds by Scathach, and a sleeping potion had been given him before, that he might not go to the battle lest anything should happen to him there.

Then Aife shattered Cuchulaind's weapon so that his sword was no longer than his fist ‘Ah,’ cried he, ‘the charioteer of Aife and her two horses and her chariot have fallen down in the glen, and have all perished!’ At that Aife looked up.

It was done in that wise.","Aiffe challenged Scáthach to combat. Cú Chulainn went to meet Aiffe, and afterwards it was asked who was dearest to her heart. Scáthach said: ‘This was dearest to her,’ said she, ‘her two horses and her chariot.’ Then Cú Chulainn and Aiffe went at each other with feats of agility and fought a contest against one another. Afterwards, Aiffe broke her weapons on Cú Chulainn, so that only the hilt of her sword remained. Then Cú Chulainn said: ‘Alas!’ said he, ‘Aiffe’s charioteer and her two chariot-horses have fallen down the glen, and all have perished.’ Aiffe looked at this in dismay. Cú Chulainn seized her at that moment, took her under his two arms, carried her across like a bundle, and brought her with him to his own host, until he struck her down to the ground with a blow and held a naked sword over her. Aiffe said: ‘Spare my life, Cú Chulainn!’ said she. ‘My three wishes to me!’ said he. ‘You shall have them as you desire,’ said she. ‘These are my three wishes,’ said he, ‘submission to Scáthach without any opposition to her thereafter, friendship with me tonight before your own fortress, and that you bear me a son.’ ‘I consent to it thus,’ said she. ‘It shall be done for you in that manner.’ Then Cú Chulainn went with Aiffe and lay with her that night. Afterwards, Aiffe said she was pregnant and would bear a son. ‘You shall send him to Ireland in seven years,’ said she, ‘and leave a name for him.’ Cú Chulainn left her a gold thumb-ring and told her that when the ring fitted his finger, he should come to Ireland, and he said that the name he should bear would be Conla, and he instructed her not to name him to any man, nor to let any man take him from his path, nor to let him engage in single combat.","Aiffe challenged Scáthach to combat. Cú Chulainn went to meet Aiffe, and afterwards it was asked who was dearest to her of all she ever loved. Scáthach said: ‘This was dearest to her,’ said she, ‘her two horses and her chariot.’ Then Cú Chulainn and Aiffe went at each other with feats of agility and fought a contest against one another. Afterwards, Aiffe broke her weapons on Cú Chulainn, so that only the hilt of her sword remained. Then Cú Chulainn said: ‘Alas, alas!’ said he, ‘Aiffe’s charioteer and her two chariot-horses have fallen down the glen, and all have perished.’ Aiffe looked at this in dismay.

He met an old woman on the road who was blind of her left eye. She asked him to beware and not be on the road before her. He said there was no room for a footing for him save on the cliff of the sea which was beneath him. She besought him to leave the road to her. Then he left the road except that his toes clung to it. When she passed over him she hit his great toe to throw him off the path down the cliff. He noticed it and leapt the hero's salmon-leap up again, and struck the woman's head off. She was the mother of the three last warriors that had fallen by him, viz., Esse Enchinde, and in order to destroy him had come to meet him.","Then Cú Chulainn and his people came to know themselves, and this is what happened, on the same string.

He let her pass on the string, but only by the tip of his toe. When she went past him, she pressed her thumb on him so that he was put under the stone. He noticed this then, and with the skill of a warrior, he sprang up again and struck the head off the old woman. She was the mother of the three last warriors who were set against him, namely Ess and Enchine, and because of their destruction, she had come against him.

He let him go from the string but only by the tip of his finger. When she went, she pressed her thumb on him to make the string go under the burden. He also perceived that, and with the skill of a warrior, he struck upwards again and cut off the head of the old woman.
