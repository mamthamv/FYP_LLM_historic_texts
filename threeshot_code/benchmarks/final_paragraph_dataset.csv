Delightful to me was it to behold  Suibhne—he whose tomb this is—at yonder  well. The Madman's Well is its name, for often would he  eat of its watercress and drink its water, and (so) the  well is named after him. Dear, too, every other place  that Suibhne used to frequent’; whereupon Moling said:"
"Táinic an búachaill dia shaigid. ‘As   dúairc  an gníomh dorighnis, a   bhúachaill,’ ar Suibhne, ‘.i.  mo   mharbadh-sa gan chionaidh úair ní fhédaim-si  festa teichedh fon ffál dobhithin na gona   doradais  form.’ ‘Dá ffeasainn-si co   mbadh tú nobheth ann,’  ar an búachaill, ‘nítgonfuinn itir gidh mór   dom  aimhles doghénta.’ ‘Dar Críosd, a   dhuine,’ ar sé,  ‘ní dhernus-sa th' aimhlessa ar áonchor ar   bioth  amail shaoile iná aimhles duine eile   ar druim dhomhainp.  ó dochuir   Día ar gealtacht mé & robadh beg a  dhíoghbháil duit-si mo bheth a ffál annso   & bainne  beg d' fagháil ar Dia   dhamh ón mnaoi ucchat, et  ní thiubhrainn   taobh frit mnáoi-si iná fri mnáoi  n-oile   ar talmhain gona thoirthaibh.’‘Mallacht Críst ort, a   bhúachaill,’ ar Moling, ‘as olc  an   gníomh dorighnis, goirde shaogail duit abhus   &  ifrenn thall ar dhénamh an   gníomha dorónais dorighnis§.’ ‘Ní  bfhuil bá do shodhain   damh-sa,’ ar Suibhne, ‘uair  tángadar   bur ccealga im thimchell & bidh im marb-sa  don guin doradadh form.’ ‘Ragaidh éric   duit ann,’  ar Moling, ‘.i. comhaitte comhfhaide§frium-sa for nimh dhuit,’  & roráidhset doraidhset§ an laoidh-si eatura ina ttriúr .i.

And I would not trust myself with your wife nor with any  other woman for the earth and its fruits.’ ‘Christ's curse on you, O herd!’ said Moling. ‘Evil  is the deed you have done, short be your span of life  here and hell beyond, because of the deed you have  done.’ ‘There is no good to me therefrom,’ said Suibhne, ‘for your wiles have compassed me and I shall  be dead from the wound that has been dealt me.’ ‘You will get an eric for it,’ said Moling, ‘even  that you be in Heaven as long as I shall be’; and the three uttered this lay between them, that is, Suibhne, Mongan, and Moling:"

Numerous too on that cliff were the beautiful trees, heavy and rich with fruits numerous also the well-sheltered ivy-trees and heavy-topped apple-trees bending to the ground with the weight of their fruit; wild deer and hares and great, heavy swine were there also, likewise many fat seals that used to sleep on that cliff after coming from the main beyond. Suibhne greatly coveted that place and he began praising and describing it aloud; whereupon he uttered this lay:"
"Táinic Suibhne roime fo dheóidh conuige an  baile i raibhe Moling .i. Teach Moling.

The psalter of Kevin was at the time in front of Moling as he was reading it to the students. In the cleric's presence Suibhne then came to the brink of the fountain and began to eat watercress.‘O  mad one, that is eating early,’ Moling spoke and Suibhne answered him:"
"‘As mochen éimh do thecht sonn, a  Shuibhne,’  ar Moling, ‘ar atá a ndán duit bheith annso & do  sháogal do  thecht ann, do sgéla & th'imthechta  d' fhágbáil sunn & th' adhnacal i  reilicc fíreóin, &  naisgim-si  fort,’ ar Moling, ‘gidh mór shire gach láoi  d' Érinn techt gacha hespurtan chugum-sa   go  rosgríobhthar do sgéla lium.’","‘Welcome in sooth is your coming here, Suibhne’, said Moling, ‘for it is destined for you to be here and  to end your life here; to leave here your history and  adventures, and to be buried in a churchyard of  righteous folk; and I bind you,’ said Moling, ‘that  however much of Ireland you may travel each day, you  will come to me each evening so that I may write your  history.’"
"Iomthúsa na geilte iarsin; robhaoi risin   mbliadhain sin ag tathaighidh Moling.

One day he would go to Innis Bo Finne in west Connacht, another day to delightful Eas Ruaidh, another day to smooth, beautiful Sliabh Mis, another day to ever-chilly Benn Boirche, but go where he would each day, he would attend at vespers each night at Teach Moling. Moling ordered a collation for him for that hour, for he told his cook to give him some of each day's milking. Muirghil was her name; she was wife of Mongan, swineherd to Moling. This was the extent of the meal the woman used to give him: she used to thrust her heel up to her ankle in the cowdung nearest her and leave the full of it of new milk there for Suibhne. He used to come cautiously and carefully into the vacant portion of the milking yard to drink the milk."

The herd's sister seeing that, came in and said to her brother: ‘You cowardly  creature, your wife is in yonder hedge with another  man,’ said she, The herd hearing that became jealous, and he rose suddenly and and and and angrily and seized a spear that was within on a rack and made for the madman. The madman's side was towards him as he was lying down eating his meal out of the cowdung. The herd made a thrust of the spear out of his hand at Suibhne and wounded him in the nipple of his left breast, so that the point went through him, breaking his back in two. (Some say that it is the point of a deer's horn the herd had placed under him in the spot where he used to take his drink out of the cowdung, that he fell on it and so met his death.)"
"Táinic taom dá chéill dó annsin & doluidh  roime ar amus a thíre do thabairt taobha re a muintir  & do anmhuin aca. Rofoillsigedh do Ronán an tan  sin a chiall do tuidhecht do Suibhne & a bheith ag  dul chum a thíre d'anadh eiter a mhuintir, co n-ébairt  Rónán: ‘Aitchim-si an Rígh uasal uilechumhachtach  nár fféde se an t-ingrinntidh sin do   ionnsaighe na  heagailsi dia hingreim   doridhisi amail dorighni fecht  n-aill   & an t-inneachadh tuc Día fair a ndíogail a  dhímhiadha-somh for a mhuintir ná raibe   furtacht  ná fóiridhin dhó dhe co roscara a   anam fri a chorp,  ar dháigh ná tiobhra a   aithghin oile do ingrinntidh  dia éis sár   nó dímigin for an cCoimdigh nach for a    mhuintir itir.’","A gleam of reason came to him then, and he set out towards his country to entrust himself to his people and abide with them. At that time it was revealed to Ronan that Suibhne had recovered his reason and that he was going to his country to abide among his folk; whereupon Ronan said: ‘I entreat the noble, almighty King that  that persecutor may not be able to approach the church  to persecute it again as he once did, and, until his  soul has parted from his body, may there be no help or  relief to him from the vengeance which God inflicted on  him in revenge for the dishonour done to His people, so  that no other like tyrant after him may inflict outrage  or dishonour on the Lord or on His people.’"

When he came among them he heard them talking to each other, and this is what they were saying: ‘He is a  madman,’ said the first head; ‘a madman of  Ulster,’ said the second head; ‘follow him  well,’ said the third head; ‘may the pursuit be  long,’ said the fourth head; ‘until he reaches  the sea,’ said the fifth head. They rose forth together towards him. He soared aloft in front of them (passing) from thicket to thicket, and no matter how vast was the glen before him he would not touch it, but would leap from one edge of it to another, and from the summit of one hill to the summit of another."

Such were the force and swiftness of that pursuit that the heads leaped on his calves, his houghs, his thighs, his shoulders, and the nape of his neck, so that the impact of head against head, and the clashing of all against the sides of trees and the heads of rocks, against the surface and the earth, seemed to him like the rush of a wild torrent from the breast of a high mountain; nor did they cease until he escaped from them into the filmy clouds of the sky."

The wandering and flying which he had ever before done were as nothing in comparison with this, for he would not rest long enough to take a drink to the end of three fortnights after that until he came one night to the summit of Sliabh Eidhneach; that night he rested there on the top of a tree until morning. He then began lamenting grievously; whereupon he said: ‘Wretched indeed is it with me  to-night after the hag and the heads on Sliabh Fuaid,  and yet it is right that I should be as I am, because of  the many to whom I myself have done harm’; whereupon he said:"

In that place he remained a year and during that year his food consisted of blood-red, saffron holly-berries and dark-brown acorns, and a drink of water from the Gabhal, that is, the river from which the wood is named. At the end of that time deep grief and heavy sorrow took hold of Suibhne there because of the wretchedness of his life; whereupon he uttered this little poem:"

For great was my kindness to the  woman who dismisses me thus, seeing that on one day I  gave her thrice fifty cows and fifty steeds; and if it  were the day I slew Oilill Cedach, king of the Ui  Faolain, she would have been glad to see me’; whereupon he said:"

Thirty feet was the height of each bronze front that was in the house. Carvings of red yew were therein. It was a board [...] below, and a roof of tiles above. The bed of Conchobor was in the front of the house, with boards of silver, with pillars of bronze, with the glitter of gold on their head-pieces, and carbuncles in them, so that day and night were equally light in it, with its silver board above the king to the highest part of the royal house. Whenever Conchobor struck the board with a royal rod, all the men of Ulster were silent thereat. The twelve beds of the twelve chariot-chiefs were round about that bed."

Splendid, lavish, and beautiful were the valiant warriors of the men of Ulster in that house. There were great and numerous gatherings of every kind in that house, and wonderful pastimes. There were games and music and singing there—viz., heroes were at their feats, poets sang, harpers and players on the timpan4 struck their sounds."

This was the drinking of the 'coal' that would satisfy all the men of Ulster at one time. The chariot-chiefs of Ulster were performing on ropes stretched across from door to door in the house at Emain. Fifteen feet and nine score was the size of that house. The chariot-chiefs were performing three feats—viz., the spear-feat, and the apple-feat, and the sword-edge feat."

The women of Ulster loved Cuchulaind greatly for his quickness at the feats, for the nimbleness of his leap, for the excellency of his wisdom; for the sweetness of his speech, for the beauty of his face, for the loveliness of his look. For there were seven pupils in his kingly eyes, four of them in his one eye, and three of them in the other. He had seven fingers on either hand, and seven toes on either of his two feet. Many were his gifts. First, his gift of prudence until his warrior's flame appeared, the gift of feats, the gift of buanfach,6 the gift of draught-playing, the gift of calculating, the gift of sooth-saying, the gift of sense, the gift of beauty. But three faults had Cuchulaind—that he was too young (for his moustache had not grown, and all the more would unknown youths deride him), that he was too daring, that he was too beautiful."
"Boi comairlie lia h-Ultai fodiag Conculaind, ar ruscarsod a man & a n-ingena co mor e, ar ni boi setig a fail Conculaind an tan sen.

This was the counsel, that they would seek a woman whom Cuchulaind might choose to woo. For they were sure that a man who had a wife to attend to him would less ravish their maidens and accept the love of their women. And, besides, they were troubled and afraid that Cuchulaind would perish early, so that for that reason they wished to give him a wife that he might leave an heir; for they knew that his re-birth would be of himself."

All the messengers returned that day a year gone, and had not found a maiden whom Cuchulaind chose to woo."
"Luid Cu Chulaind feisne  de tocmarc ingine ro-s-fitir a l-Luglochtaib Logai, edon Emer inccen Forcoild Monoch . Lod Cu Chulaind feisne & a aræ Læcc mac Riængaprai ina carput.

Then Cuchulaind himself and his charioteer Loeg, son of Riangabar (or Reincobir), went in his chariot. That was the one chariot which the host of the horses of the chariots of Ulster could not follow, on account of the swiftness and speed of the chariot and of who sat in it."

These were daughters of the lords of land that lived around the dun of Forgall. They were learning needle-work and fine handiwork from Emer. She was the one maiden whom he deigned to address and woo of the maidens of Erinn. For she had the six gifts—viz., the gift of beauty, the gift of voice, the gift of sweet speech, the gift of needle-work, the gift of wisdom, the gift of chastity. Cuchulaind said that no maiden should go with him but she who was his equal in age and shape and race, and skill and deftness, who was the best handworker of the maidens of Erinn, and that none was a fitting wife for him unless such were she. And as she was the one maiden that fulfilled all those conditions, Cuchulaind went to woo her above all."

He placed his two feet on the two edges of the basket of the cless, and bared his sword, and put its point to her heart, saying: ‘Death over thee!’ said he, ‘Thy three wishes from me!’ said she, viz., ‘thy three wishes as thou canst utter them in one breath,’ ‘They shall be taken,’ said Cuchulaind. He then pledged her. Other versions say here Cuchulaind took Scathach with him to the shore, and lay with her there, and slept with her, and that it was then that she sang this, prophesying to him everything that would befal him, saying: ‘Welcome, oh [...]’ etc. But that is not told thus after this account."

During the time that he was with Scathach and the husband of Uathach, her daughter, a certain famous man who lived in Munster, viz. Lugaid, son of Nos, son of Alamac, the renowned king, and fosterbrother of Cuchulaind, went eastward with twelve chariot-chiefs of the high kings of Munster, to woo twelve maidens of the men of Mac Rossa. All these were betrothed to men before. When Forgall the Wily heard this, he went to Tara, and said to Lugaid that the best maiden in Erinn, both in shape and chastity and handiwork, was living with him unmarried. Lugaid said it pleased him well. Then Forgall betrothed the maiden to the king; and the twelve daughters of the twelve lords of land in Bray besides to the twelve under-kings that were together with Lugaid."
"Dotæt an ri den banfeis ar oen lia Forgauld dia dunat.

When now Emer was brought to Lugaid to sit by his side, she took in both her hands his two cheeks, and laid it on the troth of his honour and his life and confessed that it was Cuchulaind she loved, that Forgall was against it, that it was loss of honour for anyone to take her to wife. Then, from fear of Cuchulaind,    Lugaid did not dare to sleep with Emer, and he returned home again."

Then the two hosts assembled to fight. Cuchulaind was put in bonds by Scathach, and a sleeping potion had been given him before, that he might not go to the battle lest anything should happen to him there. As a precaution (?) she did this. Then forthwith out of his sleep started Cuchulaind after an hour. While anybody else would have slept twenty-four hours with this sleeping potion, it was only one hour for him."

Alone he met them all three, and they fell by him. There was a meeting in battle on the next morning, and both hosts went until the two arrays were face to face. Then went the three sons of Esse Enchinde, viz. Cire and Bire and Blaicne, three other warriors of Aife, and began combat against the two sons of Scathach. They went on the path of feats. Scathach uttered a sigh at this, for she knew not what would come of it, first, as there was no third man with her two sons against those three and then she was afraid of Aife, because, she was the hardest woman-warrior in the world. Then Cuchulaind went up to her two sons, and sprang on the path, and met them all three, and they fell by him."

Scathach said: ‘What she loves most,’ said she, ‘is her two horses and her chariot and her charioteer.’ Cuchulaind and Aife went on the path of feats and began combat there. Then Aife shattered Cuchulaind's weapon so that his sword was no longer than his fist ‘Ah,’ cried he, ‘the charioteer of Aife and her two horses and her chariot have fallen down in the glen, and have all perished!’ At that Aife looked up. Then Cuchulaind approached her, seized her at her two breasts, took her on his back like a shoulder-load, and carried her with him to his own host. Then he threw her from him to the ground, and placed his bare sword over him. And Aife said: ‘Life for life, oh Cuchulaind!’ ‘My three wishes to me!’ said he, ‘Thou shalt have them, as they come with thy breath,’ said she. ‘These are my three wishes,’ said he, ‘thou to give hostage to Scathach, without ever afterwards opposing her, thou to be with me this night before thy dun, and to bear me a son,’ ‘I promise it all thus,’ said she. It was done in that wise."

He met an old woman on the road who was blind of her left eye. She asked him to beware and not be on the road before her. He said there was no room for a footing for him save on the cliff of the sea which was beneath him. She besought him to leave the road to her. Then he left the road except that his toes clung to it. When she passed over him she hit his great toe to throw him off the path down the cliff. He noticed it and leapt the hero's salmon-leap up again, and struck the woman's head off. She was the mother of the three last warriors that had fallen by him, viz., Esse Enchinde, and in order to destroy him had come to meet him."

Then Scathach told him what would befal him in the future, and sang to him in the seer's large shining ken,38 and spake these words:"
"Ticc an ingen den dunad  & ad-fet dia h-athair a      scel n-uli. Tic Cu Culaind den dunad  ierum amail cech n-óigid. Feraid failti fris ierum Conoll & Lægairi.

Thereafter Cuchulaind came to the dun like every other guest. Then Conall and Loegaire welcomed him. Many in the dun boasted of having killed the Fomori, but the maiden did not believe them. A bath was then prepared by the king, and each one was brought to her separately. Then Cuchulaind came like everybody else, and the maiden recognized him, ‘I shall give the maiden to thee.’ said Ruad, ‘and I shall pay her wedding-gift myself.’ ‘Not so,’ said Cuchulaind. ‘Let her come this day year to Erinn after me, if it be pleasant to her, and she will find me there.’"
"Tanic Cu Chulaind co h-Eamain iartain & at-fed scelai ann. O ro cuir a scis n-de, tanic reme co dunad Forcaill do cuingid Emiri.

He was a whole year near it but could not approach her for the number of the watch. He came then at the end of the year, ‘It is to-day, oh Laeg,’ said Cuchulaind, ‘we have our meeting with the daughter of Ruad, but we know not the exact place, for we were not wise. Let us go,’ said he, ‘to the border of the land.’"

Cuchulaind put a stone in his sling and aimed at the birds. The men ran up to them after having hit one of the birds. When they came up to them this is what they saw, two women, the most beautiful in the world. These were Derbforgaill, the daughter of Ruad, and her handmaid. ‘Evil is the deed thou hast done, oh Cuchulaind,’ said she. ‘It was to meet thee we came, though thou hast hurt us.’ Cuchulaind sucked the stone out    of her with its clot of blood round it. ‘I shall not wed thee now,’ said Cuchulaind, ‘for I have drunk thy blood. But I shall give thee to my companion here, viz., to Lugaid of the Red Stripes.’ And it was done thus."

And the scythe-chariot was prepared for Cuchulaind that day. It was called scythe-chariot (carpat serrda) from the iron scythes that were from it, or again because it was first invented by the Serians."

And he dealt three blows in the liss, so that eight men fell from each blow, and one man escaped in the midst of each group of nine, viz., Scibur and Ibur and Cat, three brothers of Emer. Forgall then made a leap on to the rampart of the rath without, in fleeing from Cuchulaind, and he fell and was without life. Cuchulaind took Emer with him and her foster-sister, with their two loads of gold and silver, and took a leap back again across the third rampart with the two maidens and went forth."

He dealt great angry blows on the hosts in that place, so that the streams of blood broke over it on each side. ‘The height is a turf of blood through thee today, oh Cuchulaind.’ cried the maiden. So hence it is called Crúfoit, viz., Cró-fót i.e., Turf of Blood. The pursuers overtook them at Ath n-Imfúait on the Boyne. Emer left the chariot. Cuchulaind made a chase on the shore, so that the clods flew from the hoofs of the horses across the ford northward. He made another chase northward so that the clods flew from the hoofs of the horses over the ford southward. Hence it is called Ford of the Two Clods, from the clods hither and thither."

Emer was brought into the    Red Branch to Conchobor and to the men of Ulster, and they bade her welcome. There was a grim evil-tongued man of the men of Ulster in the house, viz., Bricriu of the Venomous Tongue, the son of Arba. It was then he said: ‘Forsooth, it will be disagreeable to Cuchulaind what will happen to-night, viz., the woman whom he brought with him will sleep with Conchobor. For with him is the deflowering of virgins before the men of Ulster ever.’ Cuchulaind grew mad when he heard that, and shook himself so that the cushion burst which was under him, and its feathers were flying about the house. He went out then."
"‘Atá doiligh mor and’, ol Cathfad, ‘acht as geis don rig cen a n-doraid Bricne do denam. Do bithus Cu Chulaind immorro antí foidis  léa mnai’, ol se. ‘Goirther Cu Chulaind dund!’ ol Concvpar, ‘dús an fedfamæis talgadh a brotha.’ Tic iarum Cu Chulaind. ‘Eircc damh’, ol sé , ‘& tuc laut dam evlma failit  a Slep Fvaid.’ Teid iarum Cv Chulaind & nu-s-timaircc leis ina fvair di mucaib & d'aigib alltaib & d'ernvilib gacha fiada folvaimnige olcena i Sleip Fvaid & nu-s-beirr  a n-oinimain leis co m-bvi for faithce na h-Emno. Teidi didiu a fercc lassotain for cvla do Coin Culaind.","‘This is very hard,’ said Cathbad, ‘but it is an ordinance to the king to do everything that Bricriu has said. Cuchulaind will slay him that will sleep with his wife.’ ‘Let Cuchulaind be called to us,’ said Conchobor, ‘to know if we can soothe his wrath.’ Then Cuchulaind came. ‘Arise,’ said Conchobar, ‘and bring me the herds that I have in Slieve Fuait.’ Then Cuchulaind went, and drove together whatever he found in Slieve Fuait of swine and stags, and of every sort of fowl game besides, and drove them in one drove with him to the meadow of Emain. Then his wrath had departed from him."

This was the resolution they arrived at, that Emer was to sleep that night with Conchobor, and Fergus and Cathbad in one bed with them to watch over the honour of Cuchulaind, and the men of Ulster should bless him if he accepted it. He did accept it, and it was done thus. Conchobor paid Emer's wedding gift on the morrow, and Cuchulaind's honour price was paid, and he slept then with his wife, and they did not separate after that until they both died."

Morfesa was in Falias; Esras was in Gorias; Uiscias was in Findias; Semias was in Murias. Those are the four poets from whom the Túatha Dé learned occult lore and secret knowledge.
"Tángatar Túad Dé i morloinges mór d'indsaigid Érionn dia gabáil  ar écin for Feraib Bolc. Roloiscset a mbaraca fo cétóir íar  torrachtain críce Corcu Belgatan (.i.

Upon reaching the territory of Corcu Belgatan (which is Conmaicne Mara today), they at once burned their boats so that they would not think of fleeing to them. The smoke and the mist which came from the ships filled the land and the air which was near them. For that reason it has been thought that they arrived in clouds of mist."
"Baí didiu ben díib láu n-adn oc déicsin an marai & an tíri do tichc  Máoth Scéni .i. Éri ingen Delbaíth; go n-acui an muir fo lánféth amal  ba clár comrédh.

Ba már lee a méd, acht nát arthraigestar a delp díi;  & dobert sruth na tuinde riam decum tírei.","One day one of their women, Ériu the daughter of Delbáeth, was looking at the sea and the land from the house of Máeth Scéni; and she saw the sea as perfectly calm as if it were a level board. After that, while she was there, she saw something: a vessel of silver appeared to her on the sea. Its size seemed great to her, but its shape did not appear clearly to her; and the current of the sea carried it to the land."
"Consernad dóib íarum. Cíich an pen íarum an tan as-n-éracht an  uher.  ‘Cid cíi?’ ol é-sium.  ‘Tátham déde rocoíner,’ ol in bean. ‘Scaradh friut-sa quibindes a  comairnecmar. Maccáema Túath(a) nDéa dom nemét íar mo  cáenghuide & mo ét did-siu amal atom-cota-siu.’","Then they stretched themselves out together. The woman wept when the man got up again. ‘Why are you crying?’ he asked.‘I have two things that I should lament,’ said the woman, ‘separating from you, however we have met. The young men of the Túatha Dé Danann have been entreating me in vain—and you possess me as you do.’"
"‘Níbo hainfes det andísin,’ ol séie. ‘Dit-ánic Elothae mac  Delpaíth rí Fomore.

You will bear a son as a result of our meeting, and let no name be given to him but Eochu Bres (that is, Eochu the Beautiful), because every beautiful thing that is seen in Ireland—both plain and fortress, ale and candle, woman and man and horse—will be judged in relation to that boy, so that people will then say of it, ‘It is a Bres.’’"
"Is den cosnam-sin boí eter Túaith Déu, dobreth flaith Érenn don  mac-sin; & dobert .víí. n-aidirie di trénferuib Érenn (.i. a mátri) fri  hasic na flathae úad má fofertis a mífholtae fesin.

Then his mother gave him land, and he had a fortress built on the land, Dún mBrese. And it was the Dagda who built that fortress."
"Ba toirsich dano an Dagdo ocund obair, & atcliched daul esba  isin tech, Cridenbél a ainm, a béolae di suide asa brundie. Ba pec la Crichinphél a cuid fesin & ba már cuid an Dagdae.

Cridenbél considered his own meal small and the Dagda's large, so he said, ‘Dagda, for the sake of your honor let the three best bits of your serving be given to me!’ and the Dagda used to give them to him every night. But the satirist's bits were large: each bit was the size of a good pig. Furthermore those three bits were a third of the Dagda's serving. The Dagda's appearance was the worse for that."
"Láu n-ann didiu bai an Dagdai isin clad co n-acai an Mac n-Óc  cuige.  ‘Maith sin, a Dagdai,’ or in Mac Óc.  ‘Amin,’ ol in Dagdae.  ‘Cid deghníe drochféthol?’ ol sé.  ‘Táthum a damhnai,’ ol é-sium. ‘Cridenbél cáinte gaphas álgas  dim gacae nónae imna trí mírionn as dech dim cuibrind.’","Then one day the Dagda was in the trench and he saw the Mac Óc coming toward him. ‘Greetings to you, Dagda!’ said the Mac Óc.‘And to you,’ said the Dagda.‘What makes you look so bad?’ he asked.‘I have good cause,’ he said. ‘Every night Cridenbél the satirist demands from me the three best bits of my serving.’"

He went then to the brink of the well where he had for food that night watercress and water. Thereafter he went into the old tree of the church. The erenach of the church was Faibhlen of the family of Brughach, son of Deaghadh. That night there came an exceeding great storm so. that the extent of the night's misery affected Suibhne greatly, and he said: ‘Sad indeed is it that I was not  slain at Magh Rath rather than that I should encounter  this hardship’; whereupon he uttered this lay:"
"Táinic Suibhne roimhe iarumh co riacht an  chill ag Snámh dhá Én for Sionainn, dian comainm  Cluain Boirenn an tan sa; día na haoine dídine an  tsainridh ráinic-siumh annsin.

The clerics of the church were then fulfilling the office of nones; women were beating flax, and one was giving birth to a child. ‘It is not meet, in sooth,’ said Suibhne, ‘for the women to violate the Lord's fast-day;  even as the woman beats the flax,’ said he, ‘so  were my folk beaten in the battle of Magh Rath.’ He heard then the vesper-bell pealing, whereupon he said:‘Sweeter indeed were it to me to hear the voices of  the cuckoos on the banks of the Bann from every side  than the grig-graig of this bell which I hear to-  night’; and he uttered the lay:"
